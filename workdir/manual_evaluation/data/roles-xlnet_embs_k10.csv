Mental_property,"The adjectives and nouns in this frame are all based on the idea that mental properties may be attributed to a person (Protagonist) by a (usually implicit) Judge  on the basis of that person's Behavior, as broadly understood.  Though on a conceptual level these words always attribute mental properties to people, they may be applied to Protagonist's Behaviors as well, with the understanding that the Behavior is revealing a (usually temporary) property of the Protagonist responsible for it.

Non-gradable_proximity,"A Figure is characterized as near the Ground, according to some contextually given scale. Many lexical units of this frame additionally specify in which direction relative to the Ground one can find the Figure (under.prep, north.adv), or directions from the Ground from which the Figure is excluded (e.g. beside.prep excludes the vertical and front/back axes); for specifications of direction, see the semantic types attached to the lexcial units.

Communication_noise,"This frame contains words for types of noise which can be used to characterize verbal communication.

Make_noise,"A physical entity, construed as a point-Sound_source, emits a Sound.  This includes animals and people making noise with their vocal tracts. Sometimes the sound itself is referred to with a nominal expression, in which case it is called the Sound. Manner expressions may also be relevant in this frame, if they describe properties of the sound as such.  A path-schema can be overlaid on the simple noise-making scene, adding a Location_of_source and/or a Path. This frame does not cover scenarios where objects create sound by coming into forceful contact with one another or rubbing against each other. Such scenarios are covered by the Impact and Friction frames. The current frame also does not cover cases where an animate Agent or a natural Force or Cause causes a single Source or several Sources (moving or rubbing against each other) to make noise. Such scenarios are  covered by the Cause_to_make_noise, Cause_impact and Cause_friction frames (the latter of which is not yet existent). Cases where the major emphasis of the portrayed scene is on the motion of a Theme, with sound emission only an accompaniment, are covered by the Motion_noise frame. Likewise, cases where the Sound itself is portrayed as moving through space are not covered in this frame but rather in Sound_movement. Finally, all nouns used to evoke Sounds have been placed in the Sounds frame. We have done this because these nouns do  not denote sound emission/production events but only the Sound itself (*The siren's blare occurred right on time).","bark,beep,bellow,blare,blast,bleat,bray,burble,cackle,caterwaul,caw,chatter,cheep,chirp,chuckle,clack,clang,clash,clatter,click,coo,cough,creak,croak,crunch,drone,fizzle,gasp,giggle,gobble,growl,grunt,guffaw,gurgle,hawk,hiss,hoot,howl,hum,keen,mew,mewl,moan,moo,music,neigh,patter,peal,plash,plop,purr,quack,rasp,rattle,roar,rustle,scrape,scream,screech,scrunch,sizzle,snarl,snicker,snigger,snore,snort,sob,sough,sound,squawk,squeak,squeal,thump,thunder,tinkle,titter,toll,trumpet,tweet,twitter,ululate,wail,whimper,whine,whinny,whisper,whistle,yap,yelp,yodel,yowl","Sound: The frame element Sound is incorporated in the meaning of the verbs of this frame.
