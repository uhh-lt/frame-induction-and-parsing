Sensation	This frame contains nouns that refer to sensations in different modalities. The FE Source is used for the phenomenon that gives rise to the sensation in question. The FE Percept is used for the characteristic quality of the sensation. In cases of veridical perception these are not typically distinguished from one another; we use the FE Percept as the default in these cases. With some nouns in this frame it is possible to express the being who experiences the sensation, or the part of the body of such a being. We mark such expressions with the FEs Perceiver_passive and Body_part, respectively. (The -passive part of this label serves to distinguish this FE from the Perceiver-Agentive FE used in other frames.) 	aroma,bouquet,feel,feeling,flavour,fragrance,image,incense,noise,odor,perception,perfume,reek,savour,scene,scent,sensation,sense,sight,smell,sound,stink,taste,whiff	noises	He loped up the street in zigzags , swooping and making aeroplane <sounds> . 	1			3

Commerce_scenario	Commerce is a situation in which a Buyer and a Seller have agreed upon an exchange of Money and Goods (possibly after a negotiation), and then perform the exchange, optionally carrying it out with various kinds of direct payment or financing or the giving of change.  The Seller indicates their willingness to give the Goods in their possession to a Buyer who would give them some amount of Money.  The Seller may have already decided on the amount of money that they would require, in which case it is called the Asking price.  The Buyer also indicates their willingness to give an amount of money called an Offer to a Seller who would give them the Goods.  Normally the process is begun by the Seller.  The means by which the Seller indicates their wish to engage in an exchange are various, ranging from putting a price tag on an item on a store shelf, to advertizing, to communicating directly and specifically with a possible Buyer.  In some cases, however, the process may be initiated by the Buyer indicating to a possible Seller that they would like to make an exchange.	commerce,goods,merchandise,price,trafficker	price	Traditionally the practice has been to abandon old pits when it became uneconomic to go deeper , but to return to them when the <cost> for clay improved or when a technical innovation made extraction cheaper . 	0		2

Amalgamation	These words refer to Parts merging to form a Whole.  (The Parts may also be encoded as Part_1 and Part_2.)  There is a symmetrical relationship between the components that undergo the process, and afterwards the Parts are consumed and are no longer distinct entities that are easily discernable or separable in the Whole.	combination,merger	combination	Where this involves a mix of ISDN and multimedia ( see p 52 ) , it will bring easy access to a <mixture> of sound , text , video , data and graphics , and revolutionise desktop communications .	0		2

Deny_or_grant_permission	In this frame, an Authority allows a Protagonist to know (in some way) that they may or may not engage in an Action. For lexical units of this frame marked with the semantic type "Negative", e.g., authorize.v, the Authority has the power to tell the Protagonist not to do something, but does not do so. It is assumed that if the Protagonist engages in the Action without permission, then the Authority will punish the Protagonist in some way, at least with disapproval; if the Authority grants permission, however, the Authority is agreeing not to impose a punishment on the Protagonist for performing the Action.	approval,leave,mandate,permission,prohibition	approval	However , some analysts speculate that North Korean scientists were present during Pakistan 's nuclear tests in May 1998 , and that Pyongyang could have obtained a tested bomb design from Islamabad or from Pakistani scientists without government <authorization> .	0			3
