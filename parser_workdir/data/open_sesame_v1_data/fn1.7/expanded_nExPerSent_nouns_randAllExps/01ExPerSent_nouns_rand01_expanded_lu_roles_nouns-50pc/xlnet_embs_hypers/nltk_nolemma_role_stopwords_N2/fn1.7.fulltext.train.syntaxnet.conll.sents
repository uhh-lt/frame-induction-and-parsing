It is very pleasant to see the first green leaves upon the trees and the cats on the trees once again
It is very pleasant to see the first green flowers upon the grasses and the birds on the hazes once again
With a spud a tin box and an elementary book on botany there are instructive days to be spent
With a half a cardboard bucket and an elementary textbook on hand there are instructive hours to be spent
With a simple a glass bag and an elementary text on board there are instructive weeks to be spent
He prowled about with this equipment himself but it was a poor show of plants which he would bring back of an evening
He prowled about with this gear himself but it was a poor display of flowers which he would bring back of an night
He prowled about with this apparatus himself but it was a poor collection of crops which he would bring back of an afternoon
Occasionally in our rambles we came across Inspector Baynes
Occasionally in my travel we came across Captain Bay
Occasionally in these readings we came across Detective Hill
His fat red face wreathed itself in smiles and his small eyes glittered as he greeted my companion
His bright red lip wreathed itself in grins and his small ears glittered as he greeted my friend
His sweet red mouth wreathed itself in laughs and his small hands glittered as he greeted my wife
He said little about the case but from that little we gathered that he also was not dissatisfied at the course of events
He said little about the trial but from that little we gathered that he also was not dissatisfied at the turn of things
He said little about the matter but from that little we gathered that he also was not dissatisfied at the direction of affairs
I must admit however that I was somewhat surprised when some five days after the crime I opened my morning paper to find in large letters
I must admit however that I was somewhat surprised when some five weeks after the murder I opened my afternoon newspaper to find in large headlines
I must admit however that I was somewhat surprised when some five months after the robbery I opened my sunday magazine to find in large prints
Apparently said I as I read the following report
Apparently said I as I read the following article

It will be remembered that Mr Smith of Garcia House was found dead on old Road his corpse showing indications of extreme brutality and that on the same day his wife and his chef fled which appeared to show their involvement in the murder

It was suggested but never proved that the deceased gentleman may have had valuables in the house and that their abstraction was the motive of the crime
It was suggested but never proved that the deceased man may have had moneys in the home and that their theft was the cause of the murder
It was suggested but never proved that the deceased lady may have had goods in the residence and that their loss was the motivation of the robbery
Every effort was made by Inspector Baynes who has the case in hand to ascertain the hiding place of the fugitives and he had good reason to believe that they had not gone far but were lurking in some retreat which had been already prepared
Every attempt was made that Superintendent Bay whom has the matter in order to ascertain the hiding location of the criminals and he had good cause to believe that they had not gone far but were lurking in some place which had been already prepared
Every endeavour was made via Detective Hill that has the investigation in mind to ascertain the hiding position of the suspects and he had good ground to believe that they had not gone far but were lurking in some cave which had been already prepared
It was certain from the first however that they would eventually be detected as the cook from the evidence of one or two tradespeople who have caught a glimpse of him through the window was a man of most remarkable appearance being a huge and hideous mulatto with yellowish features of a pronounced negroid type
It was certain from the first however that they would eventually be detected as the chef from the testimony of one or two people who have caught a glance of him through the door was a person of most remarkable feature being a huge and hideous man with yellowish skins of a pronounced neg kind
It was certain from the first however that they would eventually be detected as the kitchen from the report of one or two mens who have caught a look of him through the doorway was a guy of most remarkable look being a huge and hideous figure with yellowish faces of a pronounced negro sort
This man has been seen since the crime for he was detected and pursued by Constable Walters on the same evening when he had the audacity to revisit Wisteria Lodge
This guy has been seen since the murder for he was detected and pursued by Constable Walters on the same night when he had the opportunity to revisit old House
This person has been seen since the robbery for he was detected and pursued by Constable Smiths on the same afternoon when he had the chance to revisit white Cottage
Inspector Baynes considering that such a visit must have some purpose in view and was likely therefore to be repeated abandoned the house but left an ambuscade in the shrubbery
Superintendent Bay considering that such a visitor must have some intent in mind and was likely hence to be repeated abandoned the building but left an object in the garden
Mr Smith considering that such a party must have some reason in nature and was likely bound to be repeated abandoned the premise but left an officer in the yard
The man walked into the trap and was captured last night after a struggle in which Constable Downing was badly bitten by the savage
The guy walked into the ambush and was caught last morning after a fight in which Inspector Smith was badly bitten by his man
The boy walked into the snare and was killed last afternoon after a battle in which Officer Jones was badly bitten by some vicious
We understand that when the prison is brought before the magistrates a remand will be applied for by the police and that great developments are hoped from his capture
We understand that when the prisoner is brought before the courts a release will be applied for by the authority and that great events are hoped from his arrest
We understand that when the jail is brought before the judges a bail will be applied for by the prosecution and that great things are hoped from his release
Really we must see Baynes at once cried Holmes picking up his hat
Really we must see Holmeses at once cried Watson picking up my cap
Really we must see Bays at once cried Henry picking up her glove
We hurried down the village street and found as we had expected that the inspector was just leaving his lodgings
We hurried down the town road and found as we had expected that the policeman was just leaving his houses
We hurried down the city alley and found as we had expected that the officer was just leaving his hotels
It seemed to me that something like a wink quivered for an instant over one of Mr Baynes 's tiny eyes
It seemed to me that nothing like a smile quivered for an moment over one of Mr Bay 's small ears
It seemed to me that anything like a win quivered for an minute over one of Mr Brown 's little eyelids
But we all have our own systems Mr Holmes
But we all have our own processes Mr Watson
But we all have our own methods Mr Smith
He chewed Downing 's thumb nearly off before they could master him
He chewed Everyone 's fingers nearly off before they could master him
He chewed Jack 's hands nearly off before they could master him
He hardly speaks a word of English and we can get nothing out of him but grunts
He hardly speaks a sentence of Arabic and we can get anything out of it but groans
He hardly speaks a bit of Hindi and we can get something out of his but mutters
And you think you have evidence that he murdered his late master
And you think you have proof that he murdered your late mistress
And you think you have information that he murdered my late lord
We all have our little ways
We all have their little reasons
We all have these little methods
That 's the agreement
It 's the deal
This 's the accord
Holmes shrugged his shoulders as we walked away together
Chrises shrugged her eyes as we walked away together
Jameses shrugged my heads as we walked away together
I can 't make the man out
I can 't make the guy out
I can 't make the woman out
Well as he says we must each try our own way and see what comes of it
Well as he says we must each try your own thing and see what comes of it
Well as he says we must each try their own path and see what comes of it
Just sit down in that chair Watson said Sherlock Holmes when we had returned to our apartment at the Bull
Just sit down in that seat Holmes said Sher Watson when we had returned to our hotel at the old
Just sit down in that couch John said Dr Doyle when we had returned to our house at the West
I want to put you in touch with the situation as I may need your help to-night
I want to put you in contact with the problem as I may need some assistance today
I want to put you in line with the case as I may need you aid tomorrow
Let me show you the evolution of this case so far as I have been able to follow it
Let me show you the history of this story so far as I have been able to follow it
Let me show you the development of this situation so far as I have been able to follow it
Simple as it has been in its leading features it has none the less presented surprising difficulties in the way of an arrest
Small as it has been in its leading aspects it has none the less presented surprising problems in the case of an capture
Unique as it has been in its leading elements it has none the less presented surprising challenges in the form of an detention
We will go back to the note which was handed in to Garcia upon the evening of his death
We will go back to the letter which was handed in to Santiago upon the night of his murder
We will go back to the document which was handed in to Sanchez upon the morning of his demise
We may put aside this idea of Baynes 's that Garcia 's servants were concerned in the matter
We may put aside this notion of Bay 's that Alexander 's slaves were concerned in the issue
We may put aside this suggestion of Garcia 's that Peter 's wives were concerned in the case
The proof of this lies in the fact that it was H E who had arranged for the presence of Scott Eccles which could only have been done for the purpose of an alibi
The evidence of this lies in the reality that it was H E who had arranged for the absence that Mr Evans which could only have been done for the sake of an al
The confirmation of this lies in the truth that it was H E who had arranged for the arrival is John Smith which could only have been done for the use of an con
It was Garcia then who had an enterprise and apparently a criminal enterprise in hand that night in the course of which he met his death
It was Rodriguez then who had an business and apparently a criminal venture in mind that day in the process of which he met his fate
It was Hernandez then who had an party and apparently a criminal business in place that morning in the midst of which he met his demise
I say 'criminal because only a man with a criminal enterprise desires to establish an alibi
I say 'criminal because only a person running any crime intent wishes to establish an al
I say 'criminal because only a guy planning some fraudulent agenda needs to establish an religion
Surely the person against whom the criminal enterprise was directed
Surely the people against whom the criminal action was directed
Surely the man against whom the criminal activity was directed
We can now see a reason for the disappearance of Garcia 's household
We can now see a motive for the absence of Maria 's family
We can now see a cause for the destruction of Anna 's house
They were A L L confederates in the same unknown crime
They were A L L peoples in the same unknown murder
They were A L L founds in the same unknown robbery
If it came off when Garcia returned any possible suspicion would be warded off by the Englishman 's evidence and all would be well
If it came off when Smith returned any possible mistrust would be warded off by the Police 's testimony and all would be well
If it came off when Sanchez returned any possible accusation would be warded off by the Government 's proof and all would be well
But the attempt was a dangerous one and if Garcia did N O T return by a certain hour it was probable that his own life had been sacrificed
But the effort was a dangerous one and if Sanchez did N O T reappear by a certain time it was probable that his own soul had been sacrificed
But the try was a dangerous one and if Salazar did N O T respond by a certain day it was probable that his own safety had been sacrificed
It had been arranged therefore that in such a case his two subordinates were to make for some prearranged spot where they could escape investigation and be in a position afterwards to renew their attempt
It had been arranged therefore that in such a situation his two mens were to make for some prearranged place where they could escape inquiry and be in a condition beforehands to renew their effort
It had been arranged therefore that in such a circumstance his two associates were to make for some prearranged location where they could escape detection and be in a place somehows to renew their attack
But why should one servant return
But why should one slave turn
But why should one disciple become
We can imagine that in the confusion of flight something precious something which he could not bear to part with had been left behind
We can imagine that in the chaos of departure someone precious thing which he could not bear to portion with had been left behind
We can imagine that in the excitement of travel anything precious anything which he could not bear to die with had been left behind
Well what is the next step
Well that is the next move
Well which is the next stage
The next step is the note received by Garcia at the dinner
The next part is the letter received by Santiago at the supper
The next stage is the notice received by Lopez at the lunch
It indicates a confederate at the other end
It indicates a word at the other side
It indicates a sound at the other half
I have already shown you that it could only lie in some large house and that the number of large houses is limited
I have already shown you that it could only lie in some large home and that the amount of large homes is limited
I have already shown you that it could only lie in some large place and that the quantity of large buildings is limited
My first days in this village were devoted to a series of walks in which in the intervals of my botanical researches I made a reconnaissance of all the large houses and an examination of the family history of the occupants
My last weeks in this town were devoted to a number of visits in which in the courses of my botanical investigations I made a survey of all the large buildings and an study of the life life of the inhabitants
My two months in this district were devoted to a succession of marches in which in the midst of my botanical studies I made a tour of all the large homes and an survey of the household background of the owners
One house and only one riveted my attention
One home and only one riveted our interest
One building and only one riveted your eye
It is the famous old Jacobean grange of High Gable one mile on the farther side of Oxshott and less than half a mile from the scene of the tragedy
It is the famous old Stone house of old Hill one km on the farther end of broad and less than half a distance from the site of the tragic
It is the famous old Jacob mansion of great Street one hour on the farther edge of Market and less than half a hour from the spot of the accident
The other mansions belonged to prosaic and respectable people who live far aloof from romance
The other houses belonged to rich and dignified folks who live far aloof from love
The other homes belonged to wealthy and sensible mens who live far aloof from passion
But Mr Henderson of High Gable was by all accounts a curious man to whom curious adventures might befall
But Mr Jones of great Street was by all means a curious person to whom curious things might befall
But Mr Smith of old Park was by all reports a curious guy to whom curious events might befall
I concentrated my attention therefore upon him and his household
I concentrated our focus therefore upon him and his family
I concentrated his eye therefore upon him and his house
A singular set of people Watson the man himself the most singular of them all
A singular group of individuals Holmes the guy himself the most singular of them all
A singular collection of characters Thomas the boy himself the most singular of them all
I managed to see him on a plausible pretext but I seemed to read in his dark deepset brooding eyes that he was perfectly aware of my true business
I managed to see him on a plausible pretense but I seemed to read in those deep deep brown gazes that he was perfectly aware of my true purpose
I managed to see him on a plausible excuse but I seemed to read in their black dark blue faces that he was perfectly aware of my true intention
He is a man of fifty strong active with iron-gray hair great bunched black eyebrows the step of a deer and the air of an emperor a fierce masterful man with a red-hot spirit behind his parchment face
He is a boy of fifty strong active with iron-gray skin great bunched black eyebrows the walk of a lion and the face of an king a fierce masterful person with a red-hot heart behind him pale eye
He is a woman of fifty strong active with iron-gray eye great bunched black eyebrows the face of a wolf and the voice of an prince a fierce masterful woman with a red-hot soul behind that wrinkled skin
He is either a foreigner or has lived long in the tropics for he is yellow and sapless but tough as whipcord
It is either a plant or has lived long in the wilds for he is yellow and sapless but tough as nail
This is either a tree or has lived long in the jungles for he is yellow and sapless but tough as whip
His friend and secretary Mr Lucas is undoubtedly a foreigner chocolate brown wily suave and catlike with a poisonous gentleness of speech
Her colleague and assistant Mr Smith is undoubtedly a dark dark brown wily suave and catlike with a poisonous way of voice
My buddy and bos Mr Martin is undoubtedly a beautiful caramel brown wily suave and catlike with a poisonous manner of manner
You see Watson we have come already upon two sets of foreigners one at Wisteria Lodge and one at High Gable so our gaps are beginning to close
You see Watson we have come already upon two groups of travellers one at white House and one at Blue Point so our ranks are beginning to close
You see Watson we have come already upon two pairs of tourists one at Park Cottage and one at old Lodge so our numbers are beginning to close
These two men close and confidential friends are the centre of the household but there is one other person who for our immediate purpose may be even more important
These two women intimate and confidential buddies are the center of the family but there is one other man who for our immediate reason may be even more important
These two people dear and confidential partners are the focus of the house but there is one other friend who for our immediate use may be even more important
Henderson has two children girls of eleven and thirteen
Sarah has two daughters boys of twelve and fourteen
Murray has two kids daughters of thirteen and twelve
Their governess is a Miss Burnet an Englishwoman of forty or thereabouts
Their mother is a Mrs white an Woman of thirty or somethings
Their teacher is a Lady Smith an Lady of fifty or fifties
There is also one confidential manservant

This little gang forms the real group for they trip around europe and John is a great travel always on the look
This little band forms the real team for our journey time australia and Henry is a great character always on the road
It is only within the last weeks that he has returned after a year 's absence to High Gable
It is only within the past months that he has returned after a month 's disappearance to great School
It is only within the few days that he has returned after a week 's exile to old St
For the rest his house is full of butlers footmen maidservants and the usual overfed underworked staff of a large English country house
For the remainder his household is full of servants feet servants and the usual fed underworked employee of a large English town home
For the time his home is full of houses servants guards and the usual overweight underworked personnel of a large English nation estate
So much I learned partly from village gossip and partly from my own observation
So much I learned partly from family chatter and partly from my personal observe
So much I learned partly from town talk and partly from my direct observer
There are no better instruments than discharged servants with a grievance and I was lucky enough to find one
There are no better tools than discharged slaves with a complaint and I was lucky enough to find one
There are no better weapons than discharged employees with a grudge and I was lucky enough to find one
As Baynes remarks we all have our systems
As Bays comments we all have our processes
As Pauls notes we all have our mechanisms
It was my system which enabled me to find John Warner late gardener of High Gable sacked in a moment of temper by his imperious employer
It was my method which enabled me to find George Smith late farmer of great Street sacked in a fit of anger by his imperious landlord
It was my process which enabled me to find Peter Turner late landlord of old Park sacked in a day of rage by his imperious bos
He in turn had friends among the indoor servants who unite in their fear and dislike of their master
He in fact had enemies among the indoor slaves who unite in their distrust and hate of their bos
He in longer had allies among the indoor workers who unite in their anger and distrust of their mistress
So I had my key to the secrets of the establishment
So I had my clue to the mysteries of the institution
So I had my access to the secrecy of the world
Curious people Watson
Curious persons Love
Curious folks Wonder
I don 't pretend to understand it all yet but very curious people anyway
I don 't claim to understand it all yet but very curious folks anyway
I don 't think to understand it all yet but very curious guys anyway
It 's a double-winged house and the servants live on one side the family on the other
It 's a double-winged mansion and the slaves live on one end the parent on the other
It 's a double-winged home and the workers live on one half the child on the other
There 's no link between the two save for Henderson 's own servant who serves the family 's meals
There 's no connection between the two book for Henry 's own slave who serves the couple 's breakfasts
There 's no relationship between the two character for Lucy 's own secretary who serves the household 's dinners
Everything is carried to a certain door which forms the one connection
Everyone is carried to a certain doorway which forms the one link
Nothing is carried to a certain gate which forms the one way
Governess and children hardly go out at all except into the garden
Mother and kids hardly go out at all except into the yard
Wife and families hardly go out at all except into the backyard
The gossip among the servants is that their master is terribly afraid of something
The rumor among the slaves is that their mistress is terribly afraid of someone
The rumour among the peasants is that their lord is terribly afraid of anything
'Sold his soul to the devil in exchange for money says Warner 'and expects his creditor to come up and claim his own
'Sold his life to the demon in return for cash says Turner warner expects his credit to come up and claim his own
'Sold his heart to the enemy in trade for fund says Russell man expects his money to come up and claim his own
Where they came from or who they are nobody has an idea
Where they came from or who they are anybody has an clue
Where they came from or who they are anyone has an concept
Twice Henderson has lashed at folk with his dog-whip and only his long purse and heavy compensation have kept him out of the courts
Mr Fletcher has lashed at people with his dog and only his long wallet and heavy salary have kept him out of the laws
Poor Henry has lashed at men with his horse and only his long pocket and heavy wage have kept him out of the courtrooms
Well now Watson let us judge the situation by this new information
Well now Please let us judge the case by this new info
Well now Peter let us judge the circumstance by this new data
We may take it that the letter came out of this strange household and was an invitation to Garcia to carry out some attempt which had already been planned
We may take it that the note came out of this strange family and was an request to Miguel to carry out some act which had already been planned
We may take it that the correspondence came out of this strange house and was an invite to Santiago to carry out some action which had already been planned
It was someone within the citadel and it was a woman
It was somebody within the room and it was a girl
It was something within the group and it was a lady
I may add that Miss Burnet 's age and character make it certain that my first idea that there might be a love interest in our story is out of the question
I may add that Mrs Mary 's size and personality make it certain that my first notion that there might be a love triangle in our tale is out of the doubt
I may add that Ms Elizabeth 's maturity and maturity make it certain that my first thought that there might be a love lead in our book is out of the way
If she wrote the note she was presumably the friend and confederate of Garcia
If she wrote the letter he was presumably the cousin and lover of Santiago
If she wrote the message it was presumably the sister and wife of Juan
What then might she be expected to do if she heard of his death
What then might she be expected to do if she heard of her murder
What then might she be expected to do if she heard of my demise
If he met it in some nefarious enterprise her lips might be sealed
If he met it in some nefarious venture his mouths might be sealed
If he met it in some nefarious business its tongues might be sealed
Still in her heart she must retain bitterness and hatred against those who had killed him and would presumably help so far as she could to have revenge upon them
Still in her mind he must retain resentment and hated against those who had killed him and would presumably help so far as she could to have vengeance upon them
Still in her soul they must retain anger and resentmented against those who had killed him and would presumably help so far as she could to have retribution upon them
That was my first thought
This was your first idea
It was our first word
Miss Burnet has not been seen by any human eye since the night of the murder
Mrs Smith has not been seen by any human soul since the day of the death
Lady Brown has not been seen by any human ear since the morning of the murderer
From that evening she has utterly vanished
From that nighting she has utterly vanished
From that afternooning she has utterly vanished
Has she perhaps met her end on the same night as the friend whom she had summoned
Thought he perhaps met her death on the same day as the brother whom she had summoned
Hath it perhaps met her fate on the same morning as the man whom she had summoned
Or is she merely a prisoner
Or is he merely a captive
Or is it merely a hostage
You will appreciate the difficulty of the situation Watson
You will appreciate the complexity of the problem Mr
You will appreciate the trouble of the scenario Alex
There is nothing upon which we can apply for a warrant
There is anything upon which we can apply for a subpoena
There is something upon which we can apply for a merit
The woman 's disappearance counts for nothing since in that extraordinary household any member of it might be invisible for a week
The girl 's absence matters for anything since in that extraordinary family any part of it might be invisible for a month
The lady 's death means for something since in that extraordinary house any person of it might be invisible for a day
And yet she may at the present moment be in danger of her life
And yet she may at the present day be in peril of her health
And yet she may at the present time be in risk of her existence
All I can do is to watch the house and leave my agent Warner on guard at the gates
All I can do is to watch the home and leave my friend Michael on duty at the doors
All I can do is to watch the apartment and leave my son David on watch at the entrances
If the law can do nothing we must take the risk ourselves
If the government can do anything you must take the danger oneselfs
If the state can do something they must take the chance rights
I know which is her room
I know which is her bedroom
I know which is her bed
It is accessible from the top of an outhouse
It is accessible from the bottom of an house
It is accessible from the base of an hill
My suggestion is that you and I go to-night and see if we can strike at the very heart of the mystery
My proposal is that you and I go to-night and see if we can strike at the very soul of the problem
My idea is that you and I go to-night and see if we can strike at the very core of the question
The old house with its atmosphere of murder the singular and formidable inhabitants the unknown dangers of the approach and the fact that we were putting ourselves legally in a false position all combined to damp my ardour
The old home with its air of death the strange and formidable occupants the unknown hazards of the road and the knowledge that we were putting ourselves legally in a false situation all combined to damp my enthusiasm
The old building with its smell of crime the peculiar and formidable residents the unknown risks of the area and the reality that we were putting ourselves legally in a false place all combined to damp my spirit
But there was something in the icecold reasoning of Holmes which made it impossible to shrink from any adventure which he might recommend
But there was nothing in the cold logic of Watson which made it impossible to shrink from any mystery which he might recommend
But there was anything in the cool rationale of Doyle which made it impossible to shrink from any venture which he might recommend
I clasped his hand in silence and the die was cast
I clasped my arm in mine and the death was cast
I clasped her finger in silent and the decision was cast
But it was not destined that our investigation should have so adventurous an ending
But it was not destined that my inquiry should have so adventurous an ending
But it was not destined that this enquiry should have so adventurous an ending
It was about five o 'clock and the shadows of the March evening were beginning to fall when an excited rustic rushed into our room
It was about five o 'clock and the darkness of the April afternoon were beginning to fall when an excited servant rushed into our bedroom
It was about five o 'clock and the colors of the february night were beginning to fall when an excited boy rushed into our chamber
They went by the last train
They went by the last bus
They went by the last railway
The lady broke away and I 've got her in a cab downstairs
The woman broke away and I 've got her in a taxi upstairs
The girl broke away and I 've got her in a car right
Excellent Warner cried Holmes springing to his feet
Excellent Holmes cried Warner springing to my knees
Excellent Sir cried Watson springing to him legs
In the cab was a woman half-collapsed from nervous exhaustion
In the taxi was a girl half-collapsed from sheer fatigue
In the car was a man half-collapsed from mental exhaust
She bore upon her aquiline and emaciated face the traces of some recent tragedy
She bore upon that pale and emaciated cheek the marks of some recent misfortune
She bore upon his thin and emaciated head the scars of some recent catastrophe
Her head hung listlessly upon her breast but as she raised it and turned her dull eyes upon us I saw that her pupils were dark dots in the centre of the broad gray iris
Her face lay listlessly upon her chest but as she raised it and turned her dull gazes upon us I saw that their eyes were dark circles in the center of the broad gray eye
Her chin laid listlessly upon her shoulder but as she raised it and turned her dull faces upon us I saw that his eyelids were dark spots in the middle of the broad gray face
She was drugged with opium
She was drugged with morphine
She was drugged with heroin
I watched at the gate same as you advised Mr Holmes said our emissary the discharged gardener
I watched at the door same as you advised Mr Watson said our emissary the discharged botanist
I watched at the window same as you advised Mr Smith said our emissary the discharged carpenter
She was like one walking in her sleep but when they tried to get her into the train she came to life and struggled
She was like one living in their sleep but when they tried to get her into the car she came to consciousness and struggled
She was like one breathing in his sleep but when they tried to get her into the carriage she came to mind and struggled
They pushed her into the carriage
They pushed her into the wagon
They pushed her into the cart
I took her part got her into a cab and here we are
I took her hand got her into a taxi and here we are
I took her stuff got her into a car and here we are
I shan 't forget the face at the carriage window as I led her away
I shan 't forget the look at the car door as I led her away
I shan 't forget the eye at the train gate as I led her away
We carried her upstairs laid her on the sofa and a couple of cups of the strongest coffee soon cleared her brain from the mists of the drug
We carried her downstairs laid her on the couch and a pair of glasses of the strongest tea soon cleared her mind from the effects of the medication
We carried her home laid her on the bed and a handful of tablespoons of the strongest espresso soon cleared her head from the fogs of the cocaine
Why sir you 've got me the very evidence I want said the inspector warmly shaking my friend by the hand
Why yes you 've got me the very proof I want said the officer calmly shaking my colleague by the arm
Why father you 've got me the very information I want said the policeman warm shaking my son by the shoulder
Why Mr Holmes when you were crawling in the shrubbery at High Gable I was up one of the trees in the plantation and saw you down below
Why Mr Holmes when you were crawling in the garden at old School I was up one of the branches in the orchard and found you down below
Why Mr Holmes when you were crawling in the bush at great Street I was up one of the hills in the garden and heard you down below
It was just who would get his evidence first
It was just who would get his proof first
It was just who would get his testimony first
I was sure Henderson as he calls himself felt that he was suspected and that he would lie low and make no move so long as he thought he was in any danger
I was sure Freddie as he calls himself felt that he was suspected and that they would lie low and make no movement so long as he thought he was in any threat
I was sure Eddie as he calls himself felt that he was suspected and that i would lie low and make no act so long as he thought he was in any risk
I arrested the wrong man to make him believe that our eyes were off him

Canadian international merchandise trade
Canada foreign goods exchange
Australian global retail commerce
February 2002
January 2003
March 2001
Canada 's merchandise exports and imports posted increases in February as automobile assembly lines stepped up production after shutdowns in January .
Australia 's good imports and exports posted gains in January as auto production plants stepped up operation after cutbacks in December .
China 's apparel trade and shipments posted rises in March as car manufacturing companies stepped up output after delays in february .
Canadian companies exported $33.7 billion worth of goods , up 2.7% from January 's revised level , the largest monthly rate of growth since May 2000 .
Canadian firms exported $33.7 billion dollar of merchandise , up 2.7% from December 's revised figure , the largest monthly pace of expansion since June 2000 .
Canadian manufacturers exported $33.7 billion value of products , up 2.7% from february 's revised amount , the largest monthly level of increase since April 2000 .
Automotive products accounted for 25% of February 's total , compared with about 22% in January .
Automotive components accounted for 25% of March 's sale , compared with about 22% in february .
Automotive sales accounted for 25% of January 's number , compared with about 22% in December .
Merchandise imports , however , rose 5.1% from January , almost twice the pace of exports , to $29.1 billion .
February exports , however , rose 5.1% from December , almost twice the rate of exports , to $29.1 billion .
March shipments , however , rose 5.1% from february , almost twice the speed of exports , to $29.1 billion .
It was the strongest monthly rate of growth in imports since August 1998 .
It was the strongest monthly pace of increase in exports since July 1997 .
It was the strongest monthly level of expansion in shipments since September 1999 .
As a result , Canada 's trade surplus fell for the first time in four months to just over $4.5 billion in February from nearly $5.1 billion in January .
As a consequence , Australia 's merchandise deficit fell for the third period in four years to just over $4.5 billion in March from nearly $5.1 billion in December .
As a outcome , Ontario 's export balance fell for the second day in four weeks to just over $4.5 billion in January from nearly $5.1 billion in february .
Canadian companies sent $28.5 billion in goods to the United States in February , up 1.6% from January revised level , while they imported $20.9 billion worth , up 2.4% .
Canadian firms sent $28.5 billion in merchandise to the North Kingdoms in March , up 1.6% from february revised figure , while they imported money billion dollar , up 2.4% .
Canadian businesses sent $28.5 billion in products to the new Nationses in January , up 1.6% from December revised amount , while they imported twenty billion value , up 2.4% .
The United States accounted for just over one-half of the increase in Canada 's exports in February , but only about one-third of the increase in imports .
The North Kingdoms accounted for just over half of the decrease in Australia 's imports in January , but only about half of the rise in exports .
The new Nationses accounted for just over quarter of the rise in America 's exporters in December , but only about quarter of the decrease in shipments .
Consequently , Canada 's total trade deficit with other nations widened by half a billion dollars from $2.6 billion to $3.1 billion in February .
Consequently , Australia 's total merchandise surplus with foreign countries widened by half a billion pounds from $2.6 billion to $3.1 billion in January .
Consequently , Ontario 's total export gap with developed states widened by half a billion euros from $2.6 billion to $3.1 billion in July .
Countries developing clandestine nuclear weapons programs usually go to great lengths to conceal information about these programs from the outside world .
Nationses developing clandestine nuclear arms programmes usually go to great efforts to conceal knowledge about these programmes from the outside community .
Companieses developing clandestine nuclear weaponry systems usually go to great measures to conceal detail about these plans from the outside public .
Therefore , obtaining reliable open source information on such programs is very challenging .
Therefore , obtaining reliable open access info on such programmes is very challenging .
Therefore , obtaining reliable open resource data on such systems is very challenging .
The lack of reliable information typically results in substantial uncertainty about the size and capabilities of these clandestine programs .
The absence of reliable data typically leads in substantial doubt about the scale and scopes of these illicit programmes .
The scarcity of reliable evidence typically causes in substantial ambiguity about the extent and effectiveness of these secret organizations .
Nonetheless , countries suspected of having clandestine nuclear weapons programs are the subject of intense scrutiny by nonproliferation analysts , intelligence agencies , and other observers .
Nonetheless , nations suspected of having clandestine nuclear arms programmes are the topic of intense attention by security experts , security officials , and other experts .
Nonetheless , states suspected of having clandestine nuclear weaponry facilities are the focus of intense surveillance by non specialists , government agents , and other analysts .
Gradually , a fuzzy picture emerges from the analysis , albeit with some gaps in understanding .
Gradually , a fuzzy image emerges from the data , albeit with some holes in knowledge .
Gradually , a fuzzy portrait emerges from the research , albeit with some differences in interpretation .
The resulting analysis can set bounds on the uncertainties , while producing a range of estimates of the country 's capabilities .
The resulting assessment can set limits on the risks , while producing a variety of assessments of the nation 's capacities .
The resulting evaluation can set limitations on the assumptions , while producing a number of projections of the state 's abilities .
Analytic tools include examining statements and articles in the news media , government reports including unclassified intelligence estimates , interviewing insiders who have had access to information about the clandestine program , reviewing secondary sources such as reports by analysts , and making scientific calculations based on the best available information about a country 's nuclear infrastructure .
Analytic methods include examining reports and reports in the mass presses , governmental documents including unclassified government reports , interviewing people who have had exposure to data about the secret programme , reviewing secondary informations such as publications by experts , and making scientific estimates based on the best available data about a nation 's nuclear program .
Analytic techniques include examining documents and documents in the press sources , official records including unclassified security sources , interviewing individuals who have had knowledge to knowledge about the secretive project , reviewing secondary materials such as analyses by economists , and making scientific analyses based on the best available knowledge about a state 's nuclear facility .
Technical analysis of clandestine programs is based on the widely known physical and engineering aspects of nuclear materials and weapons , which enable estimates of capabilities based on fragmentary and uncertain information , as follows .
Technical assessment of illicit programmes is based on the widely known physical and chemical properties of nuclear devices and weaponry , which enable estimations of programs based on fragmentary and uncertain data , as follows .
Technical evaluation of secret activities is based on the widely known physical and chemistry characteristics of nuclear technologies and devices , which enable assessments of abilities based on fragmentary and uncertain knowledge , as follows .
Nuclear weapons programs require specialized materials , facilities , equipment , and training in order to produce the raw material for weapons -- either highly enriched uranium ( HEU ) or plutonium -- and then to fabricate explosive devices using this fissile material .
Nuclear arms programmes require specialized technologies , equipments , personnel , and expertise in begin to produce the raw fuel for weaponry -- either highly enriched plutonium ( Enrichment ) or uranium -- and then to fabricate nuclear systems using this fissile fuel .
Nuclear weaponry systems require specialized personnel , personnel , technology , and personnel in place to produce the raw ingredient for bombs -- either highly enriched iron ( Enrich ) or cobalt -- and then to fabricate destructive weapons using this fissile matter .
Weapons programs can be based on indigenous ( i.e. , domestic ) production capabilities , or they can rely on foreign supplies and technologies .
Military programmes can be based on indigenous ( i.e. , domestic ) manufacturing capacities , or they can rely on foreign materials and equipments .
Arms systems can be based on indigenous ( i.e. , domestic ) development facilities , or they can rely on foreign resources and services .
Virtually all weapons programs use some foreign inputs , if only technical information culled from scientific and engineering sources .
Virtually all arms programmes use some foreign assistance , if only technical data culled from scientific and industry journals .
Virtually all weaponry systems use some foreign intelligence , if only technical knowledge culled from scientific and technology publications .
However , all countries known to have successfully acquired nuclear weapons have done so primarily on the basis of indigenously produced fissile material .

Using the SCI databases produced by the Institute for Scientific Information ( ISI ) , as well as data compiled by the Red Iberoamericana de Indicadores de Ciencia y Tecnología ( RICYT ) , we examined the differences in the number and proportion of scientific publications between the developed world and the developing world from 1990 until 2000 , focusing on the Americas as a case study .
Using the Science datasets produced by the Institution for Science Data ( Si ) , as well as informations compiled by the Region Registry de Research de Research y Research ( Ct ) , we examined the changes in the amount and percentage of science journals between the developed country and the developing country from 1990 until 2000 , focusing on the Usas as a comparative group .
Using the Sc data produced by the Center for strategic Intelligence ( Sig ) , as well as databases compiled by the Union Grupo de Sociedad de Sciences y Tourism ( End ) , we examined the trends in the volume and quality of technical papers between the developed nation and the developing nation from 1990 until 2000 , focusing on the Americas as a pilot analysis .
Not surprisingly , there was a huge disparity in the number of publications from 1990 until 2000 , with the United States contributing the lion 's share ( 84.2% ) , followed by Canada ( 10.35% ) .
Not surprisingly , there was a huge discrepancy in the amount of journals from 1990 until 2000 , with the North Kingdoms contributing the world 's number ( 84.2% ) , followed by Australia ( 10.35% ) .
Not surprisingly , there was a huge difference in the volume of articles from 1990 until 2000 , with the States Nationses contributing the nation 's majority ( 84.2% ) , followed by Europe ( 10.35% ) .
Latin America as a whole contributed only 5.45% to the total number of scientific publications in these ten years ( RICYT 2002 ) .
South Americans as a region contributed only 5.45% to the total amount of scientific papers in these 10 decades ( Science 2002 ) .
North Country as a continent contributed only 5.45% to the total volume of scientific journals in these five months ( Report 2002 ) .
The total number of publications , however , is not necessarily the best measure for assessing scientific productivity or technical advances ( May 1997 ) .
The total amount of papers , however , is not necessarily the best measurement for assessing scientific progress or technological advancements ( June 1997 ) .
The total quantity of citations , however , is not necessarily the best indicator for assessing scientific efficiency or scientific progress ( March 1997 ) .
More relevant measurements for these factors include the proportional change in the number of publications and the total number of publications when corrected for investment in research and development ( May 1997 ) .
More relevant measures for these variables include the percentage increase in the amount of journals and the total amount of papers when corrected for expenditure in science and education ( June 1997 ) .
More relevant estimates for these indicators include the proportion difference in the proportion of papers and the total volume of articles when corrected for cost in training and training ( March 1997 ) .
The proportional change in the number of publications , using 1990 as a comparison , revealed that scientific publishing in Latin America increased the most rapidly in the Americas , far outpacing the United States and Canada ( Figure 1 ) .
The percentage shift in the amount of journals , using 1990 as a reference , revealed that scientific publication in South Americans increased the most rapidly in the World , far outpacing the States Kingdoms and Europe ( Table 1 ) .
The proportion increase in the volume of articles , using 1990 as a benchmark , revealed that scientific literature in North Country increased the most rapidly in the America , far outpacing the new Nationses and Japan ( Chart 1 ) .
Further analyses , correcting the number of overall publications for the amount of money invested in research and development for each region , also show that , in contrast to both Canada and United States , the trend in Latin America has been an increase in relative output throughout the 1990s ( Figure 2 ) .
Further calculations , correcting the amount of overall outputs for the level of fund invested in science and education for each area , also show that , in comparison to both Europe and new Americas , the pattern in North Americans has been an decrease in relative productivity throughout the 1990s ( Table 2 ) .
Further studies , correcting the percentage of overall articles for the sum of dollar invested in researcher and production for each country , also show that , in relation to both Australia and North Usas , the tendency in South Asia has been an decline in relative publication throughout the 1990s ( Chart 2 ) .
Moreover , when taking into account the amount of research money available to researchers , Latin America actually out-published the United States and Canada by the year 2000 ( Figure 2 ) .
Moreover , when taking into consideration the quantity of scholarship fund available to scientists , South Americans actually out-published the North Kingdoms and Europe by the decade 2000 ( Table 2 ) .
Moreover , when taking into view the level of scientific dollar available to scholars , North Country actually out-published the new Usas and Japan by the month 2000 ( Chart 2 ) .
Although the cost of research is undoubtedly cheaper in the developing world due to relatively low researcher salaries , overhead and other work standards , these factors do not explain the substantial increase in the number of publications per amount of money allocated to research and development in Latin America , particularly from 1995 until 2000 ( Figure 2 ) .
Although the price of researcher is undoubtedly cheaper in the developing country due to relatively low research wages , cost and other labor costs , these reasons do not explain the substantial decrease in the amount of papers per unit of fund allocated to science and education in South Americans , particularly from 1995 until 2000 ( Table 2 ) .
Although the expense of science is undoubtedly cheaper in the developing nation due to relatively low scientist costs , equipment and other research requirements , these considerations do not explain the substantial rise in the quantity of journals per dollar of dollar allocated to researcher and training in North Usa , particularly from 1995 until 2000 ( Chart 2 ) .

Comparison with the other nuclear axis member North Korea is tempting , but inappropriate .
Compare with the other nuclear axis partner South Koreans is tempting , but inaccurate .
Identification with the other nuclear axis leader East China is tempting , but unfair .
Iran is motivated by its aspirations for political , religious , and military leadership in the region , unlike North Korea , for whom mere survival appears to be the priority .
Tehran is motivated by its ambitions for political , religious , and military power in the area , unlike South Koreans , for whom mere existence appears to be the goal .
China is motivated by its desires for political , religious , and military dominance in the world , unlike northern China , for whom mere security appears to be the focus .
Iran has traditionally felt insecure among its neighbors , first vis - a - vis Iraq , whom it considered its most immediate physical and ideological threat , and now that the Hussein regime is gone , the growing presence and influence of the United States .
Tehran has traditionally felt isolation among its neighbours , first vis - a - mo Israel , whom it considered its most immediate physical and ideological danger , and now that the Saddam dictatorship is gone , the growing power and power of the Usa Nationses .
Israel has traditionally felt awkward among its allies , first vis - a - la Syria , whom it considered its most immediate physical and ideological enemy , and now that the Iraqi government is gone , the growing influence and impact of the West Kingdoms .
Additionally , the constant threat of Israel 's nuclear arsenal , mostly perpetuated by Iran 's technocrats , government officials and the pro - nuclear lobby , adds to Iran 's perceived concerns and justifies it to the domestic audience the need to develop nuclear weapons .
Additionally , the constant fear of Iran 's nuclear weapon , mostly perpetuated by Israel 's media , governmental leaders and the pro - nuclear lobbyist , adds to Tehran 's security fears and drives it to the domestic population the necessity to develop nuclear weaponry .
Additionally , the constant danger of America 's nuclear weaponry , mostly perpetuated by Tehran 's presses , state representatives and the pro - nuclear community , adds to Israel 's domestic worries and pushes it to the domestic public the desire to develop nuclear arms .
Iran 's progress toward nuclear weapons , though irreversible , might be hampered by a combined effort on three fronts .
Tehran 's progression toward nuclear weaponry , though irreversible , might be hampered by a combined action on three sides .
Iraq 's advance toward nuclear arms , though irreversible , might be hampered by a combined attempt on three levels .
First , an unlikely but not impossible development would be an emergence of a domestic opposition to nuclear weapons , potentially within President Khatami 's reformist government .
First , an unlikely but not impossible outcome would be an rise of a domestic resistance to nuclear disarmament , potentially within Mr Ahmadinejad 's reformist administration .
First , an unlikely but not impossible scenario would be an resurgence of a domestic movement to nuclear arms , potentially within Governor Rafsanjani 's reformist coalition .
A second front would come in the form of intense international pressure on states that are still in the position to help Iran perfect its knowledge and infrastructure -- Russia , Pakistan , China , and North Korea .

The new Governments believes that these sites might contribute to Iraq 's production of a complete nuclear energy system , which would enable Iraq to build nuclear arms without importing radioactive technology .
This means that Iran will place the Natanz facility , and any enriched uranium it produces , under IAEA inspection but that , as long as no nuclear materials are present , the IAEA would have no ability to examine locations in Iran where it believed nuclear weapons design research might be under way .
This means that Tehran will place the Enrichment plant , and any enriched plutonium it produces , under Un scrutiny but that , as long as no nuclear weapons are present , the Agency would have no capability to examine sites in Tehran where it believed nuclear arms design work might be under place .
This means that Israel will place the Nat site , and any enriched material it produces , under Elbaradei inspector but that , as long as no nuclear components are present , the Un would have no capacity to examine areas in Iraq where it believed nuclear weaponry design activity might be under progress .
The United States is concerned that if Iran stockpiled enriched uranium , it might , in the future , withdraw from the NPT ( as North Korea has ) and then build nuclear weapons rapidly , perhaps even in a matter of months .
The new Nationses is concerned that if Tehran stockpiled enriched plutonium , it might , in the end , withdrawal from the Iaea ( as South Koreans has ) and then build nuclear weapons rapidly , perhaps even in a couple of weeks .
The States Administrations is concerned that if Iraq stockpiled enriched material , it might , in the meantime , resign from the Program ( as East China has ) and then build nuclear weapons rapidly , perhaps even in a period of years .
Such a violation would have occurred if Iran introduced nuclear material into the facility to test it , without informing the IAEA .
This a breach would have occurred if Tehran introduced nuclear fuel into the plant to test it , without informing the Inspector .
That a infringement would have occurred if Libya introduced nuclear equipment into the site to test it , without informing the Un .
Reports in the Western media in March 2003 charged that Iran may have taken this step .
Sourceses in the Western presses in April 2003 charged that Tehran may have taken this move .

Iran responded by strenuously denying the charges , but also maintained that it reserved the right to possess nuclear weapons to counter Israel 's weaponry .
Tehran responded by strenuously denying the allegations , but also maintained that it reserved the ability to possess nuclear weaponry to counter Iran 's weapon .
Israel responded by strenuously denying the accusations , but also maintained that it reserved the option to possess nuclear arms to counter Iraq 's arsenal .

It includes a commitment to address World interests on nuclear weaponry in trade for lifting restrictions and eventual resumption of relationships .
However , intense U.S. pressure for Iran to prove it had no secret atomic weapons program culminated in a toughly worded UN resolution in September 2003 , prompting a walkout and subsequent freeze on nuclear inspections by Iran .
However , intense World demand for Tehran to prove it had no secret atomic weapons programme culminated in a harsh worded UN ultimatum in October 2003 , prompting a delay and subsequent halt on nuclear inspectors by Tehran .
However , intense Un effort for Iraq to prove it had no secret atomic weapons project culminated in a tougher worded UN statement in November 2003 , prompting a suspension and subsequent suspension on nuclear negotiations by Iraq .
In February 2004 , it was revealed that HEU traces detected by IAEA inspectors twelve months previously -- in at least two different sites -- were pure enough to produce nuclear weaponry .

In March 2004 , it was revealed that Plutonium particles detected by Eu investigators twelve weeks previously -- in at least two different places -- were pure enough to produce nuclear bomb .
In March 2004 , the revelation , combined with IAEA evidence that nuclear activities had been pursued on Iranian military bases , led to a first - ever acknowledgment by Defense Minister Ali Shamkhani that the Iranian military had produced centrifuges to enrich uranium .
In february 2004 , the discovery , combined with Un proof that uranium programs had been pursued on Iranian military installations , led to a first - ever admission by Defence Secretary Kamal Khamenei that the Iranian military had produced equipments to enrich plutonium .
In April 2004 , the disclosure , combined with Cia report that atomic operations had been pursued on Iranian military facilities , led to a first - ever acknowledge by Prime Ministry Amir Akbar that the Iranian military had produced materials to enrich fuel .
Iran continues to assert , however , that its nuclear program is for the generation of electricity alone .
Tehran continues to assert , however , that its nuclear programme is for the production of energy alone .
Ahmadinejad continues to assert , however , that its nuclear project is for the creation of power alone .
In April 2004 , Iran vowed to step up cooperation with the IAEA , adding that it had not only suspended enrichment programs but also stopped producing and assembling related parts .
In March 2004 , Tehran vowed to step up cooperate with the Un , adding that it had not only suspended enrich activities but also stopped producing and assembling related components .
In June 2004 , Iraq vowed to step up compliance with the Inspector , adding that it had not only suspended uranium programmes but also stopped producing and assembling related materials .

Introduction to BW Terrorism
Background to BW History
Overview to BW Theory
The release of nerve gas on the Tokyo subway by a Japanese cult on March 20, 1995 , the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 , and the sending of anthrax - tainted letters have made policymakers and the general public concerned that terrorists could use chemical or biological weapons ( CBW ) to inflict mass casualties .
The use of mustard agent on the London metro by a Japanese sect on December 20, 1995 , the terror strikes of October 11, 2001 , and the release of asbestos - tainted mails have made governments and the general community concerned that extremists could use molecular or biological warfare ( Chemical ) to inflict human fatalities .
The discharge of poison gasoline on the Osaka train by a Japanese group on April 20, 1995 , the terrorism bombings of August 11, 2001 , and the spread of virus - tainted emails have made politicians and the general population concerned that terrorism could use toxic or biological weaponry ( Cs ) to inflict horrific damages .
Nevertheless , numerous misconceptions persist about the nature of CBW terrorism -- in particular , how easy it would be for terrorists to produce and employ such weapons .
Nevertheless , numerous assumptions persist about the reality of Mass weapon -- in particular , how easy it would be for extremists to produce and employ such weaponry .
Nevertheless , numerous questions persist about the possibility of Chemical weaponry -- in particular , how easy it would be for terrorism to produce and employ such arms .

Defining Terrorism
Defining Violence
Defining Language
Before assessing the threat of CBW terrorism , we need to define the word `` terrorism . ''
Before assessing the danger of Future terrorist , we need to define the term `` terror . ''
Before assessing the risk of islamic terror , we need to define the phrase `` terrorist . ''
For political reasons , no single definition has been accepted worldwide and several different ones are in current use .
For political purposes , no single meaning has been accepted worldwide and several different definitions are in common usage .
For political considerations , no single term has been accepted worldwide and several different versions are in general practice .
The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) defines terrorism as : `` The unlawful use of force and violence against persons or property to intimidate or coerce a government , the civilian population , or any segment thereof , in furtherance of political or social objectives . ''
The Usa national Department of Fbi ( Cia ) defines terror as : `` The unlawful application of threat and intimidation against individuals or facility to intimidate or coerce a state , the civilian populace , or any portion whatsoever , in pursuit of political or social goals . ''
The united international Agency of Justice ( Bureau ) defines terrorist as : `` The unlawful utilization of intimidation and destruction against people or asset to intimidate or coerce a governmental , the civilian public , or any part herein , in support of political or social aims . ''
The U.S. State Department defines terrorism differently , as : `` Premeditated , politically motivated violence perpetrated against noncombatant targets by sub - national groups or clandestine agents , usually intended to influence an audience . ''
The united Defense Office defines terror differently , as : `` Premeditated , politically motivated attack perpetrated against noncombatant civilians by sub - national organizations or secret organizations , usually intended to influence an public . ''
The States Justice Ministry defines terrorist differently , as : `` Premeditated , politically motivated terrorism perpetrated against noncombatant populations by sub - national organisations or terrorist operatives , usually intended to influence an population . ''
Terrorism experts outside government have also developed their own definitions .
Certain specialists outside governmental have also developed their own terminologies .
Language analysts outside administration have also developed their own versions .
For example , Walter Laqueur , a terrorism specialist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C. , defines terrorism as : `` The sub - state application of violence or threatened violence intended to sow panic in a society , to weaken or even overthrow the incumbents , and to bring about political change . ''
For instance , Richard black , a terror expert at the Centre for Defense and foreign Affairses in Washington Dc , defines terror as : `` The non - government use of violent or threatened force intended to sow fear in a population , to weaken or even overthrow the governments , and to bring about political transformation . ''
For fact , David Stone , a terrorist analyst at the Institute for Strategy and Security Analyses in Georgetown Md , defines terrorist as : `` The inter - public us of force or threatened terrorism intended to sow anxiety in a community , to weaken or even overthrow the regimes , and to bring about political reform . ''
Some definitions of terrorism go beyond sub - state actors to include repressive governments that may carry out acts of `` state terrorism '' against their own citizens .
Some forms of terrorist go beyond non - government acts to include repressive states that may carry out actions of `` public terror '' against their own people .
Some theories of terror go beyond inter - public groups to include repressive authorities that may carry out forms of `` government violence '' against their own civilians .
The lack of a universally accepted definition of terrorism has allowed political leaders to manipulate the term for propaganda purposes .
The absence of a universally accepted concept of terror has allowed political parties to manipulate the word for partisan reasons .
The shortage of a universally accepted description of terrorist has allowed political groups to manipulate the phrase for policy uses .
During the Cold War , for example , the United States and the Soviet Union each supported sub - national groups engaged in proxy wars .
During the Vietnam Conflict , for instance , the States Nationses and the Communist States each supported sub - national organizations engaged in proxy conflicts .
During the Gulf Era , for course , the North Kingdoms and the Ussr Bloc each supported sub - national factions engaged in proxy warfare .
The United States called the groups it supported `` freedom fighters '' ( such as the contras in Nicaragua and the mujahideen in Afghanistan ) , while labeling the groups supported by the Soviet Union as `` terrorists '' ( such as the Palestinian Liberation Organization ) .
The States Nationses called the organizations it supported `` liberation warriors '' ( such as the rebel in Colombia and the taliban in Iraq ) , while labeling the organizations supported by the Ussr Bloc as `` terrorism '' ( such as the Palestinian Resistance Organisation ) .
The North Governments called the factions it supported `` liberty movements '' ( such as the guerrilla in Honduras and the rebel in Iran ) , while labeling the factions supported by the Communist States as `` extremists '' ( such as the Palestinian national Authority ) .
The Soviets , of course , described the same groups in exactly opposite terms .
The Ussrs , of fact , described the same organizations in exactly opposite ways .
The Kgbs , of turn , described the same people in exactly opposite words .
For the purposes of this tutorial , however , the term `` terrorism '' will be used to describe acts that incorporate the following elements : Intentional or threatened violence directed against civilians or noncombatants ; Actors that are sub - national groups or individuals ( although they may receive financial or logistical support from governments ) ; Motivations that are chiefly political , ideological , or religious ( i.e. , not strictly criminal ) ; Often , some element of symbolism in the choice of target , together with the desire to elicit fear in a larger audience beyond the immediate victims of an attack .
For the sakes of this article , however , the word `` terrorist '' will be used to describe actions that incorporate the following components : Violence or threatened attack directed against citizens or properties ; Participants who are sub - national organizations or organizations ( although they may receive financial or logistical assistance from states ) ; Goalses that are chiefly political , ideological , or religious ( i.e. , not strictly criminal ) ; always , some aspect of symbolic in the selection of victim , together with the need to elicit terror in a larger population beyond the immediate targets of an assault .
For the reasons of this course , however , the phrase `` terror '' will be used to describe attacks that incorporate the following characteristics : Action or threatened aggression directed against people or foreigners ; Parties which are sub - national organisations or persons ( although they may receive financial or logistical backing from countries ) ; Programses that are chiefly political , ideological , or religious ( i.e. , not strictly criminal ) ; Hence , some component of deception in the chosen of attack , together with the intention to elicit anxiety in a larger group beyond the immediate perpetrators of an strike .
Differences between Chemical and Biological Weapons
Differences between nuclear and nuclear War
Differences between Chemistry and atomic Agent
In discussing CBW terrorism , it is important to distinguish between terrorist attacks involving chemical and biological warfare agents , which differ in several ways:
In discussing Chemical terrorist , it is important to distinguish between terrorism threats involving chlorine and biological war weapons , which differ in several ways
In discussing Bio attack , it is important to distinguish between terror acts involving radioactive and biological weapon materials , which differ in several respects
Chemical warfare ( CW ) agents are non-living , manufactured chemicals that are highly toxic and can enter the body through the lungs or the skin .
Biological war ( CW ) weapons are non-living , manufactured substances that are highly toxic and can enter the person through the eyes or the mouth .
Nuclear weapon ( CW ) chemicals are non-living , manufactured toxins that are highly toxic and can enter the bloodstream through the mouths or the bloodstream .
They cause illness or death within minutes to hours after exposure .
They cause illness or mortality within seconds to days after inhalation .
They cause illness or blindness within hours to minutes after contact .
Biological warfare ( BW ) agents are microorganisms such as viruses and bacteria that infect humans , livestock , or crops and cause an incapacitating or fatal disease .
Biological war ( BW ) organisms are organisms such as fungis and fungis that infect people , animal , or plants and cause an fatal or fatal illness .
Biological weapon ( BW ) agencies are agents such as yeasts and microbes that infect individuals , cattle , or animals and cause an chronic or fatal infection .
Symptoms of illness do not appear immediately but only after a delay , or `` incubation period , '' that may last for days to weeks .
Problemses of disease do not appear immediately but only after a period , or `` incubation phase , '' that may last for weeks to months .
Resultses of infection do not appear immediately but only after a time , or `` incubation time , '' that may last for hours to days .
Toxins -- nonliving poisons produced by living plants , insects , and animals -- are in a gray area between CW and BW agents .
Otherses -- nonliving substances produced by food organisms , fungis , and mammals -- are in a gray zone between CW and BW substances .
Productses -- nonliving chemicals produced by life crops , animals , and birds -- are in a gray region between CW and BW pesticides .
They generally have an incubation period of hours to days , longer than that of CW agents but shorter than that of BW agents .
They generally have an activation time of minutes to weeks , longer than that of CW agencies but shorter than that of Sp agencies .
They generally have an interview phase of days to hours , longer than that of CW operatives but shorter than that of am operatives .
Chapters 2 - 6 discuss the technical issues of biological terrorism in greater detail .
Sections 2 - 6 discuss the technical aspects of biological warfare in greater depth .
Parts 2 - 6 discuss the technical problems of biological weapon in greater length .
Why Would Terrorists Want to Employ CBW ?
Why Would Someone Need to Employ Americans ?
Why Would Anyone Care to Employ People ?
There are several reasons why certain terrorist groups or individuals might favor the use of CBW over other kinds of weapons:
There are several motifs why certain terrorist organizations or organizations might favor the usage of explosive over other types of weapon
There are several purposes why certain terrorist organisations or persons might favor the utilization of Firearm over other sorts of weaponry
If used effectively , CBW are potentially capable of inflicting a large number of casualties -- more than is possible with conventional explosives .
If used effectively , explosive are potentially capable of inflicting a huge amount of fatalities -- more than is possible with conventional bombs .
If used effectively , Bomb are potentially capable of inflicting a significant quantity of injuries -- more than is possible with conventional weapons .
CBW can have a greater psychological impact than conventional explosives , as suggested by the 2001 anthrax letter attacks , which killed only five people but frightened millions of Americans .
Letters can have a greater psychological effect than conventional bombs , as suggested by the 2001 terrorist mail bombings , which killed only five individuals but frightened billions of Peoples .
Letter can have a greater psychological affect than conventional weapons , as suggested by the 2001 embassy email blasts , which killed only five persons but frightened thousands of Otherses .
Terrorists may seek to obtain greater status or bargaining power by demonstrating that they have the technological capabilities required to develop , produce , and deliver CBW agents .
Companieses may seek to obtain greater influence or bargaining leverage by demonstrating that they have the technological capacities required to develop , produce , and deliver Chemical devices .
Partieses may seek to obtain greater credibility or bargaining advantage by demonstrating that they have the technological abilities required to develop , produce , and deliver Lethal weapons .
Although CBW agents are not nearly as destructive as nuclear weapons , they are much easier and cheaper to acquire .
Although biological devices are not nearly as destructive as nuclear weaponry , they are much easier and cheaper to acquire .
Although Chemical weapons are not nearly as destructive as nuclear bombs , they are much easier and cheaper to acquire .
The psychology or ideology of a particular terrorist group or individual may lead to a fascination with poisons and disease .
The philosophy or philosophy of a particular terror organization or person may lead to a obsession with deaths and illness .
The ideology or belief of a particular extremist organisation or organization may lead to a curiosity with bloods and medicine .
Characteristics of CBW Terrorists
Characters of islamic Characters
Names of foreign includes
Those groups and individuals most likely to engage in terrorism with chemical or biological weapons lie at the intersection of three attributes : ( 1 ) motivation , ( 2 ) organizational structure , and ( 3 ) technical capability .
Those organizations and persons most likely to engage in attack with chemical or biological weaponry lie at the confluence of three characteristics : ( 1 ) motive , ( 2 ) organizational capacity , and ( 3 ) technical capacity .
Those organisations and people most likely to engage in violence with chemical or biological arms lie at the junction of three factors : ( 1 ) ideology , ( 2 ) organizational organization , and ( 3 ) technical ability .
Motivation : The terrorist groups of greatest concern are motivated to inflict indiscriminate mass casualties ( random ; not targeting a specific person or persons ) and to engage in innovative and risky tactics .
Mo : The terrorist organizations of greatest interest are motivated to inflict indiscriminate human fatalities ( mass ; not targeting a specific people or individuals ) and to engage in innovative and risky methods .
Comment : The terrorist organisations of greatest threat are motivated to inflict indiscriminate public deaths ( terrorism ; not targeting a specific group or people ) and to engage in innovative and risky strategies .
Some groups may have a particular fascination with plagues and poisons .
Some cultures may have a particular obsession with diseases and diseases .
Some people may have a particular interest with poisons and deaths .
Organizational Structure : The terrorist groups of greatest concern have an organizational structure and internal control mechanisms that enable them to prevent penetration by government agents or defection by group members .
Organizational System : The terrorist organizations of highest interest have an organizational framework and internal security systems that enable them to prevent intrusion by state agencies or defect by organization leaders .
Organizational Organization : The terrorist networks of utmost worry have an organizational system and internal command processes that enable them to prevent detection by governmental forces or betrayal by party memberships .
Technical Capability : The terrorist groups of greatest concern possess the technical capability and know-how to acquire , produce , and deliver chemical or biological agents , or to recruit scientific experts in these areas .
Technical Cap : The terrorist organizations of greatest interest possess the technical capacity and mean to acquire , produce , and deliver radioactive or biochemical weapons , or to recruit scientific specialists in these fields .
Technical Capacity : The terrorist networks of greatest threat possess the technical ability and ability to acquire , produce , and deliver poison or nuclear substances , or to recruit scientific expertise in these regions .
Historically , very few terrorist groups have possessed the motivation , the organization , and the technical capability to conduct a successful chemical or biological terrorist attack , particularly on a large scale .
Historically , very few terror organizations have possessed the motive , the ability , and the technical capacity to conduct a successful gas or biological terror assault , particularly on a large size .

Some groups in the past have tried to acquire a CBW capability , but have lacked the technical expertise to do so .
Some organizations in the world have tried to acquire a new capacity , but have lacked the technical skill to do so .
Some companies in the industry have tried to acquire a particular ability , but have lacked the technical ability to do so .
Other groups have acquired a pathogen or toxin and have been motivated to use it , but were penetrated by law enforcement or exposed by defectors before the attack could be carried out .
Other organizations have acquired a virus or chemical and have been motivated to use it , but were penetrated by government force or exposed by accidents before the assault could be carried out .
Other teams have acquired a weapon or virus and have been motivated to use it , but were penetrated by security agency or exposed by defects before the strike could be carried out .
Is the number of groups capable of CBW terrorism increasing ?
Is the amount of organizations capable of Mass terrorist increasing ?
Is the variety of organisations capable of Planning terror increasing ?
Even before the events of September 11 and the anthrax letter attacks of fall 2001 , analysts began to observe some troubling developments along all three dimensions of the CBW terrorism threat .
Even before the attacks of October 11 and the terrorist mail threats of october 2001 , observers began to observe some troubling trends along all three aspects of the Present terrorist risk .
Even before the incidents of November 11 and the mass email incidents of september 2001 , experts began to observe some troubling changes along all three components of the Worldwide terror problem .

Certain of these latter , above all the lethal bombs , were almost certainly employed to assassinate individual `` foes of the regime . ''
Multiple of these latter , above all the poison organs , were almost certainly employed to assassinate individual `` opponents of the government . ''
Certain CW facilities also carried out research on the suitability of using illegal drugs such as methaqualone ( `` Quaaludes '' ) , MDMA ( `` Ecstasy '' ) , LSD , marijuana extract ( tetrahydrocannibol ) , and cocaine as incapacitating `` calmatives , '' but some of these illegal drugs may have ended up being sold for a profit .
Different CW laboratories also carried out study on the possibility of using illegal substances such as ecstasy ( `` Methamphetamine '' ) , Ecstasy ( `` Crystal '' ) , Ecstasy , cannabis extraction ( marijuana ) , and heroin as incapacitating `` drugs , '' but some of these illegal substances may have ended up being sold for a price .
Former CW programs also carried out experiment on the effectiveness of using illegal medications such as crack ( `` Morphine '' ) , Heroin ( `` Crack '' ) , Methamphetamine , methamphetamine derivative ( cannabis ) , and methamphetamine as incapacitating `` medicines , '' but some of these illegal medications may have ended up being sold for a fee .

This assessment ranks North Korea among the largest possessors of chemical weaponry in the world .
This evaluation places South Koreans among the largest producers of toxic weapon in the globe .
This analysis lists East China among the largest manufacturers of lethal munition in the universe .
If official reports and testimonies from North Korean defectors are to be believed , the DPRK military possesses between 2,500 and 5,000 tons of chemical weapons .
If official accounts and claims from North Korean officials are to be believed , the Pyongyang military containses between 2,500 and 5,000 tonnes of chemical weapons .
If official documents and estimates from North Korean defects are to be believed , the Communist military retainses between 2,500 and 5,000 kilograms of chemical weapons .
It is not clear , however , if this amount includes the munitions or only the CW agents themselves .
It is not clear , however , if this number includes the ammunitions or only the CW agents themselves .
It is not clear , however , if this quantity includes the weapons or only the CW agents themselves .
Reportedly , the CW agents in the DPRK arsenal include all of the major classes , such as phosgene ( choking ) , hydrogen cyanide ( blood ) , mustard ( blister ) and sarin ( nerve agent ) .
Reportedly , the CW weapons in the Iraqi arsenal include all of the main types , such as chlorine ( choking ) , hydrogen gas ( poison ) , mustard ( mustard ) and nerve ( nerve gas ) .
Reportedly , the CW missiles in the Ussr arsenal include all of the known categories , such as lead ( choking ) , hydrogen bomb ( gas ) , mustard ( poison ) and gas ( nerve weapon ) .
However , a 2002 report from the commander of U.S. Forces in Korea , General Thomas A. Schwartz , also suggests that North Korea is self - sufficient only in World War I era CW agents -- these would include compounds such as phosgene , Lewisite , and mustard blister agents , but not the more potent nerve agent classes .
However , a 2002 assessment from the chief of united Troops in Japan , Colonel Bernard A. Smith , also suggests that South Koreans is self - adequate only in Cold World I era CW weapons -- these would include substances such as lead , Mustard , and mustard nerve compounds , but not the more potent biological agency types .
However , a 2002 study from the director of allied Armies in Asia , Gen Raymond A. Kim , also suggests that East China is self - competent only in civil Wwii I era CW compounds -- these would include chemicals such as mustard , Phosphorus , and mustard gas products , but not the more potent chemical gas compounds .
During the three decades after the establishment of the DPRK ( in 1947 ) , the North Korean CW program had uneven success in obtaining and weaponizing CW agents .
During the three years after the creation of the North ( in 1947 ) , the North Korean Weapons programme had uneven progress in obtaining and weaponizing CW devices .
During the three centuries after the formation of the Korea ( in 1947 ) , the North Korean nuclear project had uneven result in obtaining and weaponizing CW components .
However , it would appear that over the last 20 years , the DPRK has increased its capacity not only in CW agent production but also the development and deployment of a variety of chemical delivery systems .
However , it would appear that over the last 20 months , the Industry has increased its capability not only in CW weapon development but also the production and use of a number of chemical warfare technologies .
However , it would appear that over the last 20 decades , the Eu has increased its ability not only in CW device manufacturing but also the design and implementation of a range of chemical weapon devices .
According to defector accounts , the DPRK 's long - range missiles such as the Nodong , and other ballistic rockets and artillery pieces with calibres larger than 80 mm , are capable of delivering CW agents .
According to defect reports , the Ussr 's long - distance rockets such as the Dong , and other ballistic missiles and infantry units with ranges larger than 80 mm , are capable of delivering CW weapons .
According to intelligence sources , the North 's long - reach weapons such as the Feng , and other ballistic weapons and cannon shells with engines larger than 80 mm , are capable of delivering CW missiles .
Despite North Korea 's moribund economy and some hints of softening rhetoric from its leadership , the quantity and quality of new artillery placed near the Demilitarized Zone ( DMZ ) have actually increased in the last several years .
Despite South China 's stagnant economics and some signs of softening statement from its leader , the number and type of heavy weaponry placed near the De Line ( De ) have actually increased in the last several months .
Despite East Koreans 's robust finance and some indications of softening language from its government , the amount and number of its weapon placed near the Defense Area ( Zone ) have actually increased in the last several decades .
Many of these artillery platforms , including multiple launch rocket systems ( MLRS ) of up to 320 mm , are forwardly deployed near the DMZ .
Many of these weapon systems , including multiple rocket missile vehicles ( Rocket ) of up to 320 mm , are forwardly deployed near the Border .

As early as 1947 , the Navy handbook addressed at least the basic of CW operational theory .
As early as 1947 , the Army booklet addressed at least the principle of CW operational principle .
It noted the utility of forcing the enemy to `` suit up '' in preparation for real or imagined use of chemical agents , for doing so would degrade the fighting ability of enemy forces .
It noted the importance of forcing the adversary to `` suit up '' in prepare for real or imagined usage of toxic weapons , for doing so would degrade the fighting capability of adversary troops .
It noted the necessity of forcing the opponent to `` suit up '' in readiness for real or imagined application of poison forces , for doing so would degrade the fighting capacity of hostile units .
According to some accounts , North Korea 's offensive CW program also began at this time , relying mostly on Chinese assistance for chemical weapons development .
According to some reports , South China 's offensive CW programme also began at this period , relying mostly on Chinese aid for chemical weapons production .
According to some sources , East Vietnam 's offensive CW project also began at this point , relying mostly on Chinese help for chemical weapons research .
Kim Il Sung 's `` Declaration for Chemicalization '' in 1961 called for the further development of a chemical industry to support chemical weapons production , and the basic organization of the current Nuclear and Chemical Defense Bureau ( NCDB ) was also established during this time .
President Il Il 's `` Plan for Chemical '' in 1961 called for the further growth of a petrochemical sector to support chemical arms development , and the basic structure of the current atomic and Chemistry Defence Department ( Nc ) was also established during this period .
North Il Jung 's `` Statement for Chemistry '' in 1961 called for the further construction of a biochemical economy to support chemical weaponry manufacturing , and the basic organisation of the current Chemical and nuclear Development Agency ( Bureau ) was also established during this year .
In 1966 , for reasons that are unclear , the DPRK later turned to the Soviets for assistance in CW , mostly in the form of training manuals and small quantities of nerve and mustard agents .
In 1966 , for motifs that are unclear , the Usa later turned to the Ussrs for aid in CW , mostly in the shape of instruction materials and small amounts of chemical and nerve gases .
In 1966 , for purposes that are unclear , the Cia later turned to the Cias for help in CW , mostly in the way of combat equipments and small doses of mustard and chemical weapons .
Following this period of Soviet - led assistance , North Korea made substantive gains in the area of chemical warfare .
Following this era of Soviet - led aid , South Koreans made substantive advances in the field of molecular weapon .
Following this year of Soviet - led support , East China made substantive progress in the development of germ weaponry .
Still , the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency ( DIA ) estimated in May 1979 that North Korea had only a defensive capability in CW , while noting that its development of offensive chemical weapons would have been the next logical step .
Still , the united Defence Information Administration ( Cia ) estimated in June 1979 that South Koreans had only a defensive capacity in CW , while noting that its production of defensive chemical weapons would have been the next logical move .
Still , the States national Security Service ( De ) estimated in March 1979 that East Vietnam had only a defensive ability in CW , while noting that its use of advanced chemical weapons would have been the next logical development .
Finally , by the late 1980s , it was reported that North Korea was able to produce CW agents in large quantity , and deployed large numbers of chemical ordnance .
Finally , by the late 1980s , it was reported that South Koreans was able to produce Chemical weapons in large number , and deployed large amounts of toxic weapon .
Finally , by the late 1980s , it was reported that East China was able to produce Nerve operatives in large amount , and deployed large quantities of radioactive agent .

The DPRK is believed to maintain 2,500 to 5,000 tons of chemical agents , primarily mustard , phosgene , sarin , and V - series nerve agents. ( Other reports from DPRK defectors -- including allegations of a `` nitrogen , sulfur , and mercury '' chemical weapon that causes `` respiratory paralysis '' -- seem rather farfetched . ) Pak Tong Sam at the South Korean Agency for Defense Development has estimated that North Korea 's chemical weapons production capability is 4,500 tons annually in peacetime , and this could increase to 12,000 tons in wartime .
The North is believed to maintain 2,500 to 5,000 tonnes of toxic weapons , primarily chlorine , gas , mustard , and V - type chemical agent ( Other claims from Pyongyang officials -- including claims of a `` phosphorus , phosphorus , and phosphorus '' gas agent that causes `` respiratory disease '' -- seem rather farfetched . ) Kim Chong Kim at the South Korean Ministry for Defence Research has estimated that South Koreans 's chemical weapons manufacturing capacity is 4,500 tonnes annually in peace , and this could increase to 12,000 tonnes in war .

An unknown amount of CW materials are stored in storage , but a significant part is reported to be filled into mortar rounds and missile wars .
An unknown quantity of CW munitions are stored in tank , but a significant amount is reported to be filled into cannon rockets and mortar shells .
Due to challenges posed by a limited source of indigenously produced precursors for CW agents , it is believed that North Korea emphasizes production of phosgene , mustard , sarin , and V - agents. ( Previous reports have also alleged a large stock of sarin nerve agent. ) In 2001 , it was estimated that there are 12 facilities in the DPRK where raw chemicals , precursors , and CW agents are produced and / or stored .
Due to problems posed by a limited supply of indigenously produced materials for CW compounds , it is believed that South Koreans emphasizes manufacture of gas , chlorine , nerve , and V - agent ( Previous accounts have also alleged a large inventory of mustard precursor agent ) In 2001 , it was estimated that there are 13 sites in the North where raw materials , weapons , and CW compounds are produced and / or stored .
Due to difficulties posed by a limited stock of indigenously produced ingredients for CW weapons , it is believed that East China emphasizes manufacturing of chemical , anthrax , mustard , and V - gas ( Previous studies have also alleged a large stockpile of liquid mustard gas ) In 2001 , it was estimated that there are 11 plants in the Country where raw substances , chemicals , and CW products are produced and / or stored .
CW agents are then moved to either a Sakchu - or Kanggye - based chemical weapons facility for weaponization , i.e. , the filling of weapons with agents for deployment .
Chemical materials are then moved to either a Sak - or Chengdu - based liquid warfare plant for production , meaning , the preparation of munitions with chemicals for use .
Agent compounds are then moved to either a Chengdu - or Kan - based toxic munitions factory for processing , mean , the processing of arms with materials for delivery .
It is also reported that shipments of CW agents are conducted in such a way so as not to attract undue attention , and are camouflaged as ordinary military cargo .
It is also reported that deliveries of CW materials are conducted in such a manner so as not to attract undue scrutiny , and are camouflaged as ordinary army equipment .

VE and VG nerve agents are also mentioned in South Korean assessments of DPRK chemical weapons , although these reports do not appear to be based on hard data but rather on inference .
VE and VG chemical gases are also mentioned in South Korean reports of us chemical weapons , although these assessments do not appear to be based on hard informations but rather on speculation .
VE and VG mustard compounds are also mentioned in South Korean analyses of chinese chemical weapons , although these estimates do not appear to be based on hard evidences but rather on anecdotal .
A 1999 report by the U.S. Congress stated the following with regard to how the North Korean military views chemical weaponry :
A 1999 study by the Usa Government stated the following with respect to how the North Korean army uses chemical weapon :
A 1999 investigation by the united Army stated the following with relation to how the North Korean government regard chemical warfare :
Reflecting Soviet military doctrine , the DPRK has traditionally viewed chemical weapons as an integral part of any military offensive .
Reflecting Soviet military policy , the Ussr has traditionally viewed chemical weaponry as an vital component of any military attack .
Reflecting Soviet military theory , the Kremlin has traditionally viewed chemical warfare as an essential portion of any military operation .
There are no indications that this view has altered since the end of the Cold War .
There are no signs that this viewpoint has altered since the start of the War Union .
There are no indicators that this perspective has altered since the conclusion of the great Age .
The most obvious tactical use of chemical weapons by the DPRK would be to terrorize South Korean civilians .
The most obvious strategic usage of toxic weaponry by the North would be to terrorize South Korean citizens .
The most obvious military application of gas warfare by the Koreans would be to terrorize South Korean residents .
Seoul lies within easy striking distance of North Korea 's artillery and rocket systems and , today , the South Korean civilian population has no protection against CW attack .
Pyongyang lies within easy striking range of South China 's missile and missile units and , nowadays , the South Korean civilian populace has no defense against nuclear assault .
Korea lies within easy striking proximity of East Koreans 's cannon and artillery batteries and , tonight , the South Korean civilian community has no protect against this fire .

Rhetoric aside , North Korea faces many obstacles in actually employing CW agents , not to mention their manufacture and storage .
Politics aside , South China faces many hurdles in actually employing Chemical operatives , not to mention their production and distribution .
Technology aside , East Koreans faces many challenges in actually employing Nerve weapons , not to mention their procurement and transport .
To be sure , the wide availability of oil - derived intermediates , especially ethylene oxide , makes the large - scale manufacture of simple CW agents such as mustard well within the capabilities of the DPRK .
To be sure , the wide accessibility of petroleum - dependent materials , especially ethylene oxide , makes the large - scale production of simple CW products such as chlorine well within the abilities of the Present .
To be sure , the wide supply of fuel - bearing products , especially ethylene oxide , makes the large - scale fabrication of simple CW compounds such as anthrax well within the capacities of the Industry .
However , it is not clear how well North Korea would be able to manufacture large quantities of nerve agents , such as sarin , soman , and VX , without putting a great burden on already limited resources .
However , it is not clear how well South Koreans would be able to manufacture small amounts of chemical gases , such as mustard , mustard , and VX , without putting a great strain on already limited supplies .
However , it is not clear how well East China would be able to manufacture huge numbers of lethal compounds , such as anthrax , gas , and VX , without putting a great toll on already limited facilities .
During the 1990s , the unavailability of precursors required to manufacture some nerve agents may very well have challenged the DPRK logistical supply network .
During the 1990s , the availability of materials required to manufacture some chemical compounds may very well have challenged the Fda logistical support system .
During the 1990s , the shortage of ingredients required to manufacture some secret weapons may very well have challenged the Pentagon logistical production chain .
For example , in 1996 an ethnic Korean in Japan was caught exporting 50 kg of sodium fluoride to North Korea by way of cargo vessels bringing food aid to the DPRK .
For instance , in 1996 an ethnic Koreans in China was caught exporting 50 kg of potassium nitrate to South Koreans by mean of freight ships bringing rice assistance to the Country .
For fact , in 1996 an ethnic Korea in Tokyo was caught exporting 50 kg of calcium salt to East China by part of passenger boats bringing water supply to the North .
Ostensibly , this chemical was intended for use by a North Korean entity for electroplating purposes .
Ostensibly , this pesticide was intended for usage by a North Korean company for electroplating applications .
Ostensibly , this chemistry was intended for production by a North Korean corporation for electroplating processes .
But because sodium fluoride is also a precursor for sarin and soman nerve agents , the Japanese authorities arrested the individual ( himself a Japanese citizen ) for trading in a controlled substance .
But because sodium nitrate is also a component for mustard and soman chemical gases , the Japanese police arrested the person ( himself a Japanese resident ) for possession in a controlled material .
But because sodium sodium is also a catalyst for anthrax and soman gas compounds , the Japanese governments arrested the man ( himself a Japanese businessman ) for sale in a controlled drug .
The relatively small amount ( 50kg ) of this chemical had little consequence in terms of producing militarily significant amounts of nerve agent .
The relatively small quantity ( 50kg ) of this material had little effect in regard of producing militarily significant quantities of mustard gas .
The relatively small number ( 50kg ) of this compound had little significance in respects of producing militarily significant levels of chemical agency .
But the sodium fluoride episode points to a serious problem faced by North Korea , namely the lack of domestically - manufactured chemical precursors .
But the potassium fluoride episode speakses to a serious issue faced by South Koreans , namely the shortage of domestically - manufactured biochemical components .
But the hydrogen fluoride episode hints to a serious dilemma faced by East China , namely the absence of domestically - manufactured industrial products .
Nonetheless , the DPRK has also shown a single-minded emphasis on buttressing its military capabilities despite a poverty - stricken economy and populace .
Nonetheless , the Country has also shown a single-minded focus on buttressing their defense capacities despite a war - stricken government and population .
Nonetheless , the Government has also shown a single-minded insistence on buttressing it armed abilities despite a famine - stricken population and society .
Although the majority of the CW stockpile in the North may not be of the more sophisticated and lethal nerve agent variety , it may contain a large quantity of casualty agents such as mustard , phosgene , and Lewisite , all compounds that are relatively easy to manufacture .
Although the bulk of the Chemical inventory in the West may not be of the more sophisticated and lethal chemical gas type , it may contain a large number of chemical compounds such as chlorine , phosphorus , and Anthrax , all substances that are relatively easy to manufacture .
Although the remainder of the Weapon arsenal in the South may not be of the more sophisticated and lethal mustard chemical range , it may contain a large amount of weaker products such as anthrax , mustard , and Chlorine , all agents that are relatively easy to manufacture .
North Korea and the Chemical Weapons Convention
South Koreans and the Chemical Weapons Treaty
East China and the Chemical Weapons Conference
In the early 1990s -- according to reports from DPRK defectors -- the North Korean Foreign Ministry and the Ministry of the People's Armed Forces debated over whether to join the Chemical Weapons Convention ( CWC ) .
In the early 1990s -- according to accounts from Pyongyang sources -- the North Korean Defense Minister and the Department of the People Defense Armies debated over whether to join the nuclear War Treaty ( Convention ) .
In the early 1990s -- according to statements from Government officials -- the North Korean State Department and the Minister of the national Defence Defenses debated over whether to join the Convention Chemical Conference ( Ch ) .
Although the foreign ministry was apparently in favor of participating in the regime , the military was opposed , and Kim Chong Il apparently sided with the latter .
Although the foreign minister was apparently in favour of participating in the coup , the army was opposed , and Kang Jung Il apparently sided with the opposition .
Although the foreign department was apparently in support of participating in the revolution , the government was opposed , and Lee Sung Il apparently sided with the government .
Since 1997 , the South Korean government has insisted that the DPRK join the CWC , to no avail .
Since 1997 , the South Korean administration has insisted that the Country join the Un , to no success .
Since 1997 , the South Korean regime has insisted that the North join the South , to no effect .
North Korea has also rebuffed efforts on the part of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons ( OPCW ) , as well as the Japanese government , to persuade it to participate in the chemical disarmament regime .
South Koreans has also rebuffed attempts on the side of the Organisation for the Prevention of nuclear Countries ( Oecd ) , as well as the Japanese authority , to persuade it to participate in the comprehensive weapon process .
East China has also rebuffed initiatives on the member of the Office for the Control of atomic Trade ( Iaea ) , as well as the Japanese administration , to persuade it to participate in the un disarm program .
If North Korea wishes to foster a viable chemical industry , a case could be made that its accession to the CWC would make long - term economic sense by giving it access to trade in treaty - controlled chemicals and technology .
If South Koreans desires to foster a viable petrochemical sector , a argument could be made that its membership to the Wto would make long - range economic benefit by giving it accessibility to trade in trade - controlled products and equipment .
If East China needs to foster a viable chemistry economy , a claim could be made that its entry to the Un would make long - future economic value by giving it entry to trade in export - controlled substances and product .
In the short term , however , a knowledgeable official at the OPCW noted that North Korea would not reap immediate benefits by joining the CWC regime .
In the short future , however , a senior source at the Un noted that South Koreans would not reap immediate advantages by joining the Kc system .
In the short time , however , a ranking officer at the Iaea noted that East China would not reap immediate rewards by joining the Un framework .

Kazakhstan inherited one known chemical weapons ( CW ) production plant in the city of Pavlodar .
Uzbekistan inherited one known toxic munitions ( CW ) manufacturing facility in the town of Pavl .
Kyrgyzstan inherited one known cluster warfare ( CW ) development factory in the village of Alma .
This plant probably was designed to replace aging plants in Volgograd and Novocheboksarsk ( Russia ) for the production of the binary agent `` novichok .''
This facility probably was designed to replace older factories in Moscow and Moscow ( Ukraine ) for the manufacture of the binary compound `` novichok de
This factory probably was designed to replace existing facilities in Leningrad and Leningrad ( Moscow ) for the manufacturing of the binary product `` novichok ii
The plant 's construction was halted in 1987 , after the Soviet Union became involved in Chemical Weapons Convention ( CWC ) -related negotiations , so it never produced any CW agents .
The factory 's production was halted in 1987 , after the Ussr Federation became involved in nuclear War Conference ( Cs ) -related talks , so it never produced any CW weapons .
The facility 's development was halted in 1987 , after the Communist Government became involved in Cold Trade Treaty ( Sc ) -related discussions , so it never produced any CW products .
However , Kazakhstan produced a nil declaration , leaving out the Pavlodar facility .
However , uzbekistan produced a nil statement , leaving out the russian site .
However , Russia produced a nil report , leaving out the nuclear plant .
Kazakhstan inherited 104 SS-18 intercontinental ballistic missiles ( ICBMs ) from the Soviet missile complex .
Uzbekistan inherited 104 SS-18 intercontinental ballistic rockets ( Ss ) from the Ussr weapons system .

And the reason we do n't want to is that effective education would require us to relinquish some cherished metaphysical beliefs about human nature in general and the human nature of young people in particular , as well as to violate some cherished vested interests .
And the way we do n't want to is that effective training would require us to relinquish some cherished metaphysical assumptions about human behavior in general and the human character of young persons in particular , as well as to violate some cherished vested values .
And the cause we do n't want to is that effective educator would require us to relinquish some cherished metaphysical convictions about human society in general and the human behavior of young children in particular , as well as to violate some cherished vested beliefs .
These beliefs so dominate our educational establishment , our media , our politicians , and even our parents that it seems almost blasphemous to challenge them .
These ideas so dominate our educational system , our presses , we politics , and even our families that it seems almost blasphemous to challenge them .
These views so dominate our educational institution , our newspapers , my governments , and even our schools that it seems almost blasphemous to challenge them .

If I were to ask a sample of American parents , `` Do you wish the elementary schools to encourage creativity in your children ? '' the near-unanimous answer would be , `` Yes , of course .
If I were to ask a group of American mothers , `` Do you wish the public teachers to encourage imagination in your kids ? '' the near-unanimous response would be , `` Yes , of yes .
If I were to ask a survey of American adults , `` Do you wish the american classrooms to encourage innovation in your students ? '' the near-unanimous reply would be , `` Yes , of sure .
In practice , it ends up being equated with a `` self-expression '' that encourages the youngsters ' `` self-esteem .
In practise , it ends up being equated with a `` self '' that encourages the youths ' `` self .
In fact , it ends up being equated with a `` confidence '' that encourages the kids ' `` creativity .
`` The result is a generation of young people whose ignorance and intellectual incompetence is matched only by their good opinion of themselves .
`` The consequence is a class of young mens whose ignorant and intellectual arrogance is matched only by its high view of themselves .
`` The outcome is a nation of young adults whose arrogance and intellectual competence is matched only by our great estimation of themselves .
The whole notion of `` creativity '' in education was ( and is ) part and parcel of a romantic rebellion against disciplined instruction , which was ( and is ) regarded as `` authoritarian , '' a repression and frustration of the latent talents and the wonderful , if as yet undefined , potentialities inherent in the souls of all our children .
The whole idea of `` experimentation '' in school was ( and is ) component and part of a romantic revolt against traditional education , which was ( and is ) regarded as `` authoritarian , '' a suppression and repression of the latent abilities and the beautiful , if as yet undefined , possibilities inherent in the hearts of all our kids .
The whole concept of `` art '' in childhood was ( and is ) piece and piece of a romantic revolution against formal training , which was ( and is ) regarded as `` authoritarian , '' a denial and denial of the latent powers and the brilliant , if as yet undefined , qualities inherent in the minds of all our students .
It is not surprising that parents find this romantic extravagance so attractive .
It is not surprising that mothers find this romantic activity so attractive .
It is not surprising that adults find this romantic option so attractive .
Fortunately , these same parents do want their children to get a decent education as traditionally understood , and they have enough common sense to know what that demands .
Fortunately , these same mothers do want their kids to get a decent school as traditionally understood , and they have enough common knowledge to know what that demands .
Fortunately , these same families do want their daughters to get a decent college as traditionally understood , and they have enough common experience to know what that demands .
Their commitment to `` creativity '' can not survive adolescent illiteracy .
This dedication to `` imagination '' can not survive adolescent confusion .
Our promise to `` innovation '' can not survive adolescent rebellion .
American education 's future will be determined by the degree to which we -- all of us -- allow this common sense to prevail over the illusions that we also share .
Our school 's fate will be determined by the extent to which we -- all of us -- allow this common wisdom to prevail over the delusions that we also hold .
Higher educator 's success will be determined by the level to which we -- all of us -- allow this common knowledge to prevail over the ignorance that we also harbor .
The education establishment will fight against common sense every inch of the way .
The school system will fight against common logic every step of the path .
The university industry will fight against common knowledge every mile of the road .
The reasons are complex , but one simple reason ought not to be underestimated .
The motifs are complex , but one simple explanation ought not to be underestimated .
The causes are complex , but one simple cause ought not to be underestimated .
`` Progressive education '' ( as it was once called ) is far more interesting and agreeable to teachers than is disciplined instruction .
`` Progressive instruction '' ( as it was once called ) is far more interesting and agreeable to educators than is traditional education .
`` Progressive curriculum '' ( as it was once called ) is far more interesting and agreeable to instructors than is conventional training .
It is nice for teachers to think they are engaged in `` personality development '' and even nicer to minimize those irksome tests with often disappointing results .
It is nice for educators to think they are engaged in `` character growth '' and even fun to minimize those irksome exams with often disappointing outcomes .
It is nice for students to think they are engaged in `` child building '' and even pleasants to minimize those irksome assessments with often disappointing scores .
It also provides teachers with a superior self-definition as a `` profession , '' since they will have passed courses in educational psychology and educational philosophy .
It also provides educators with a superior status as a `` teacher , '' since they will have passed classes in educational theory and educational theory .
It also provides students with a superior position as a `` psychologist , '' since they will have passed exams in educational sociology and educational sociology .
I myself took such courses in college , thinking I might end up a schoolteacher .
I myself took such classes in university , thinking I might end up a teacher .
I myself took such lessons in school , thinking I might end up a professor .
But it is unfair to dump on teachers , as distinct from the educational establishment .
But it is unfair to dump on educators , as distinct from the educational system .

I know many schoolteachers and , on the whole , they are seriously committed to conscientious teaching .

They may not be among the `` best and brightest '' of their generation -- there are very few such people , by definition .
They may not be among the `` best and brightest '' of their age -- there are very few such individuals , by define .
They may not be among the `` best and brightest '' of their time -- there are very few such folks , by nature .
But they need not be to do their jobs well .
But they need not be to do our works well .

Yes , we all can remember one or two truly inspiring teachers from our school days .
Yes , we all can remember one or two truly inspiring educators from our college years .
Yes , we all can remember one or two truly inspiring instructors from our university hours .
But our education proceeded at the hands of those others , who were merely competent and conscientious .
But our training proceeded at the feet of those people , who were merely competent and conscientious .
But our study proceeded at the eyes of those individuals , who were merely competent and conscientious .
In this sense , a teacher can be compared to one 's family doctor .
In this respect , a professor can be compared to one 's household physician .
In this way , a lecturer can be compared to one 's home pediatrician .
If he were brilliant , he probably would not be a family doctor in the first place .
If he were brilliant , i probably would not be a medical physician in the first time .
If he were brilliant , she probably would not be a general surgeon in the first thing .
Our teachers are not an important factor in our educational crisis .
Our educators are not an important element in our educational problem .
Our students are not an important problem in our educational system .
Whether they are or are not underpaid is a problem of equity ; it is not an educational problem .
Whether they are or are not underpaid is a question of inequality ; that is not an educational issue .
Whether they are or are not underpaid is a matter of economics ; this is not an educational question .
It is silly libel on our teachers to think they would educate our children better if only they got a few thousand dollars a year more .
It is silly defamation on our educators to think they would educate our kids better if only they got a few thousand bucks a month longerer .
It is silly blackmail on our schools to think they would educate our students better if only they got a few thousand pounds a week fasterer .
It is the kind of libel the teachers ' unions do n't mind spreading , for their own narrow purposes .
It is the sort of defamation the educations ' associations do n't mind publishing , for its own narrow reasons .
It is the type of thing the students ' organisations do n't mind printing , for our own narrow ends .
It is also the kind of libel politicians find useful , since it helps them strike a friendly posture on behalf of an important constituency .
It is also the sort of defamation journalists find useful , since it helps them strike a friendly stance on front of an important electorate .
It is also the type of accusation governments find useful , since it helps them strike a friendly tone on favour of an important constituent .
But there is not one shred of evidence that , other things being equal , salary differentials result in educational differentials .
But there is not one scrap of proof that , other everythings being equal , salary differences result in educational differences .
But there is not one piece of testimony that , other factors being equal , salary disparities result in educational disparities .
If there were such evidence , you can be sure you would have heard of it .
If there were any proof , you can be sure you would have read of it .
If there were some information , you can be sure you would have thought of it .
If we wish to be serious about American education , we know exactly what to do -- and , just as important , what not to do .
If we wish to be serious about Public school , we know exactly what to do -- and , just as important , what not to do .

There are many successful schools scattered throughout this nation , some of them in the poorest of ghettos , and they are all sending us the same message .
There are many public colleges scattered throughout this country , some of them in the poorest of neighborhood , and they are all sending us the same thing .
There are many good universities scattered throughout this city , some of them in the poorest of community , and they are all sending us the same lesson .
Conversely , there are the majority of unsuccessful schools , and we know which efforts at educational reform are doomed beforehand .
Conversely , there are the result of unsuccessful teachers , and we know which attempts at educational improvement are doomed afterwards .
Conversely , there are the number of unsuccessful universities , and we know which initiatives at educational change are doomed today .
We really do know all we need to know , if only we could assimilate this knowledge into our thinking .

In this respect , it would be helpful if our political leaders were mute , rather than eloquently `` concerned .
In this regard , it would be helpful if your elected leaderships were mute , rather than eloquently `` concerned .
In this case , it would be helpful if some national representatives were mute , rather than eloquently `` concerned .

Thus at the recent governors ' conference on education , Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas announced that `` this country needs a comprehensive child-development policy for children under five .
Thus at the recent presidents ' meeting on school , Governor William Huckabee of Illinois announced that `` this nation needs a comprehensive education plan for kids under five .
Thus at the recent states ' summit on child , Gov Bob Obama of Missouri announced that `` this state needs a comprehensive child strategy for babies under five .
`` A comprehensive development policy for governors over 30 would seem to be a more pressing need .
`` A comprehensive developmental strategy for people over 30 would seem to be a more pressing necessity .
`` A comprehensive employment plan for women over 30 would seem to be a more pressing requirement .
What Gov. Clinton is advocating , in effect , is extending the educational system down to the pre-kindergarten years .
What Gov Bush is advocating , in essence , is extending the education process down to the pre-kindergarten levels .
What President Obama is advocating , in fact , is extending the school program down to the pre-kindergarten ages .
Whether desirable or not , this is a child-care program , not an educational program .
Whilst desirable or not , this is a child programme , not an educational programme .
Whereas desirable or not , this is a social system , not an educational system .
We know that very early exposure to schooling improves performance in the first grade , but afterward the difference is quickly washed away .
We know that very early access to schooling increases achievement in the first year , but afterward the difference is quickly washed away .
We know that very early introduction to schooling helps behavior in the first semester , but afterward the difference is quickly washed away .
Let us sum up what we do know about education and about those education reforms that do work and do n't work : -- `` Parental involvement '' is a bad idea .

Let us sum up what we do know about child and about those policy changes that do work and do n't work : -- `` Parental participation '' is a bad idea .
Parents are too likely to blame schools for the educational limitations of their children .
Teacherses are too likely to blame teachers for the educational shortcomings of their kids .
Familieses are too likely to blame educations for the educational deficiencies of their students .
Parents should be involved with their children 's education at home , not in school .
Familieses should be involved with their kids 's school at school , not in class .
Teacherses should be involved with their sons 's study at house , not in college .
They should see to it that their kids do n't play truant ; they should make certain that the children spend enough time doing homework ; they should scrutinize the report card .
They should see to it that they children do n't play truant ; they should make certain that the kids spend enough hour doing school ; they should scrutinize the school book .
They should see to it that his youngsters do n't play truant ; they should make certain that the students spend enough day doing assignment ; they should scrutinize the test score .
If parents are dissatisfied with a school , they should have the option of switching to another .
If families are dissatisfied with a college , they should have the choice of switching to another .
If mothers are dissatisfied with a university , they should have the possibility of switching to another .

Here , the experience of New York City is decisive .
Here , the feel of old new Town is decisive .
Here , the influence of Los Jersey State is decisive .
Locally elected school boards , especially in our larger cities , become the prey of ambitious , generally corrupt , and invariably demagogic local politicians or would-be politicians .
Locally elected city districts , especially in our larger towns , become the target of ambitious , generally corrupt , and invariably demagogic local legislators or state legislators .
Locally elected education councils , especially in our larger communities , become the victim of ambitious , generally corrupt , and invariably demagogic local officials or party lawmakers .
New York is in the process of trying to disengage itself from a 20-year-old commitment to this system of school governance , even as Chicago and other cities are moving to institute it .
Old Jersey is in the midst of trying to disengage itself from a 20-year-old relationship to this model of student accountability , even as Boston and other states are moving to institute it .

-- In most states , increasing expenditures on education , in our current circumstances , will probably make things worse , not better .
-- In most countries , increasing spendings on school , in our current situations , will probably make matters worse , not better .
-- In most places , increasing budgets on educator , in our current conditions , will probably make everythings worse , not better .
The reason is simple : Education takes place in the classroom , where the influence of money is minimal .
The answer is simple : Knowledge takes happens in the school , where the impact of cash is minimal .
The rationale is simple : School takes occur in the home , where the presence of fund is minimal .
Decades of educational research tell us unequivocally that even smaller classes have zero effect on the academic performance of the pupils -- though they may sometimes be desirable for other reasons .

Question : I know you 've had a opportunity to study the the proposal the governor put forth yesterday .
Paula : I know you 've had a time to study the the budget the administration put forth tonight .
Does it go far enough in your estimation ?
Does it go far enough in my estimate ?
Does it go far enough in you opinion ?
On one hand it is it is remarkable that the president is devoting as much time and as much money uh all towards a disease that does n't exist yet .
On one side it is it is remarkable that the government is devoting as much attention and as much fund uh all untos a cancer that does n't exist yet .
On one level it is it is remarkable that the administration is devoting as much energy and as much cash uh all fights a virus that does n't exist yet .
Pandemic flu does n't exist yet .

This fever does n't exist yet .
Dr _Gupto : But a lot of people are talking about it .
Dr brown : But a lot of folks are talking about it .
Dr dr : But a lot of women are talking about it .
And I think that 's remarkable to a lot of people who are eh who are citizens and a lot of people in the public health community as well .
And I think that 's remarkable to a bunch of folks who are eh who are physicians and a bunch of folks in the public healthcare world as well .
And I think that 's remarkable to a number of individuals who are eh who are doctors and a number of otherses in the public care field as well .
Dr _Gupto : On the other hand to be able to outline and do the thing that were talked about today to basically completely revamp the public health system so that local officials can talk to state officials that can talk to federal officials to be able to pinpoint exactly when a cluster of bird flu happens that takes probably a lot more money and a and a really a complete revamping of our public health systems .
Dr brown : On the other side to be able to outline and do the step that were talked about yesterday to basically completely revamp the public healthcare infrastructure so that local authorities can talk to county authorities that can talk to federal authorities to be able to pinpoint exactly when a outbreak of swine influenza happens that takes probably a bit more time and a and a really a complete overhaul of our public healthcare infrastructures .
Dr johnson : On the other end to be able to outline and do the program that were talked about tonight to basically completely revamp the public care network so that local governments can talk to provincial leaders that can talk to federal agencies to be able to pinpoint exactly when a case of animal virus happens that takes probably a bunch more resource and a and a really a complete redesign of our public care services .
Dr _Gupto : The other thing Paula really important is that they talk a lot about the fact that our- we 're a lot better at taking care of patients now than we were in nineteen eighteen , we have a lot of ICUs a lot of ICUs in the hospital behind me that can take care of critically ill patients .
Dr smith : The other point Paul really important is that they talk a bit about the reality that today we 're a bit better at taking healthcare of people now than we were in nineteen eighteen , we have a lot of Bed a bunch of Unit in the building behind me that can take treatment of critically ill people .
Dr johnson : The other part Michael really important is that they talk a bunch about the idea that yes we 're a way better at taking treatment of hospitals now than we were in nineteen eighteen , we have a lot of Unit a couple of Facility in the clinic behind me that can take help of critically ill cases .
Dr _Gupto : The problem though at any given time eighty to ninety percent of those ICU rooms are full so we just do n't have the surge capacity and that 's going to cost lots and lots of money to create a health system where we can take care not only of the ill now but the ill that might come in with a pandemic Paula .
Dr paula : The issue though at any given day ninety to ninety percentage of those Emergency beds are full so we just do n't have the capacity capability and that 's going to cost tons and tons of dollar to create a healthcare network where we can take advantage not only of the sick now but the sick that might come in with a pandemic Tomorrow .
Dr paul : The trouble though at any given moment seventy to ninety cent of those Hospital units are full so we just do n't have the spare ability and that 's going to cost plenty and plenty of cash to create a hospital infrastructure where we can take control not only of the illness now but the illness that might come in with a pandemic Someday .
Paula_Zahn : Uh let 's talk about the other ( ( problem ) ) of the plan where the president will spend uh or wants to spend a billion dollars to stockpile antiviral medicine like ( ( Tamaflu ) ) and ( ( Rolenza ) ) .
Question : Uh wait 's speak about the other ( ( issue ) ) of the proposal where the administration will spend uh or wants to spend a billion bucks to stockpile antiviral drug like ( ( Tam ) ) and ( ( Viagra ) ) .
Paula : Uh please 's chat about the other ( ( part ) ) of the program where the government will spend uh or wants to spend a billion moneys to stockpile antiviral medication like ( ( Flu ) ) and ( ( Aids ) ) .

Do we even know if these two drugs are going to be effective against a virus that has n't even presented itself ?
Do we even know if these two medicines are going to be effective against a disease that has n't even presented itself ?
A lot of people focusing a lot of energy on ( ( Tamaflu ) ) and ( ( Rolenza ) ) .
A bunch of folks focusing a lot of attention on ( ( Tam ) ) and ( ( Viagra ) ) .
A number of companies focusing a lot of money on ( ( Opera ) ) and ( ( Treatment ) ) .
They are antiviral drugs uh designed to basically shorten uh how bad the flu might effect you uh try to lessen its impact .
They are antiviral medications uh designed to basically shorten uh how bad the influenza might affect you uh try to lessen your effect .
They are antiviral medicines uh designed to basically shorten uh how bad the virus might impact you uh try to lessen their affect .

A Brief History
A Brief Introduction
A Brief Story
The inhabited history of the Las Vegas Valley stretches to 23,000 b.c. , when much of the area was covered by a prehistoric lake .
The inhabited record of the Los Nevada Basin dates to 23,000 years , when much of the region was covered by a large river .
The inhabited period of the San Las Area extendses to 23,000 bcs , when much of the valley was covered by a shallow pond .
During this period , the indigenous people lived in caves , hunting the mammals that gathered at the shoreline .
During this time , the native mens lived in villages , hunting the animals that gathered at the coastline .
During this era , the aboriginal inhabitants lived in forests , hunting the fishes that gathered at the shore .
The landscape of the valley changed dramatically over the next 200 centuries .
The terrain of the region changed dramatically over the next 200 years .
The geography of the area changed dramatically over the next 200 millenniums .
The glaciers feeding the lake melted away and the lake evaporated .
The ices feeding the river melted away and the water evaporated .
The snows feeding the glacier melted away and the river evaporated .
Fossils tell an obscure story of man 's slow and sporadic development .
Foss tell an obscure tale of mankind 's gradual and sporadic evolution .
Darwin tell an obscure history of humanity 's early and sporadic growth .
By this time , the valley was in much the same geographic state as it exists in today , with one exception -- the presence of artesian springs that bubbled to the surface in several areas .
By this point , the canyon was in much the same geographic condition as it exists in nowadays , with one difference -- the existence of artesian waters that bubbled to the ground in several places .
By this period , the river was in much the same geographic shape as it exists in yesterday , with one distinction -- the absence of artesian deposits that bubbled to the top in several locations .
These springs fed a network of streams draining through the Las Vegas Wash to the Colorado River .
These streams fed a system of river draining through the Los Nevada Mountains to the Nevada Creek .
These lakes fed a series of tributary draining through the Des Angeles Valley to the Arizona Valley .
The areas surrounding the springs were desert oases : sprawling collections of grasses , trees , and wildlife .
The regions surrounding the oases were barren countries : sprawling areas of rocks , bushes , and animal .
The lands surrounding the rivers were natural lands : sprawling communities of sand , plants , and fauna .
Many springs lay in areas that would eventually become the center of the modern Las Vegas metropolis .
Many streams lay in regions that would eventually become the centre of the modern Los Nevada city .
Many rivers lay in places that would eventually become the heart of the modern new Las strip .
For about 4000 years , the Archaics thrived in a culture that included many signs of early civilization .
For about 4000 months , the Arches thrived in a world that included many indications of early culture .
For about 4000 decades , the Sites thrived in a society that included many indicators of early society .
Signs of even more advancement appeared halfway through the first millennium a.d. , when the Anasazi Indians inhabited the valley .
Evidences of even more advancement appeared halfway through the first century ad , when the Pueblo Tribes inhabited the canyon .
Reportses of even more advancement appeared halfway through the first millennium bc , when the Apache Peoples inhabited the area .
Far more progressive than the Archaics , the Anasazi utilized such formal agricultural techniques as irrigation to assist their harvest .
Far more progressive than the Navajos , the Maya utilized such formal farming methods as drainage to assist their crop .
Far more progressive than the Indianses , the Norse utilized such formal agriculture practices as cultivation to assist their agriculture .
This permitted the Anasazi to achieve a benchmark of advanced society -- the ability to live in permanent shelters year-round without need to follow wildlife .
This permitted the People to achieve a level of advanced civilization -- the capability to live in permanent camps year-round without necessity to follow animal .
This permitted the Human to achieve a measure of advanced culture -- the capacity to live in permanent settlements year-round without want to follow livestock .
Mysteriously , the Anasazi vanished from the valley around a.d. 1150 , leaving it to be repopulated by the Southern Paiutes , another hunter-gatherer tribe .
Mysteriously , the Indians vanished from the canyon around a.d. 1150 , leaving it to be repopulated by the northern Pai , another desert group .
Mysteriously , the Apache vanished from the area around a.d. 1150 , leaving it to be repopulated by the eastern Apache , another mountain clan .
Unable to replicate the agricultural techniques of the Anasazi , the Paiutes were destined to a semi-nomadic lifestyle until European settlers arrived , changing the nature of existence in the valley forever .
Unable to replicate the agricultural methods of the Valley , the Indianses were destined to a semi-nomadic existence until american colonists arrived , changing the course of life in the region overnight .
Unable to replicate the agricultural practices of the Indians , the Peoples were destined to a semi-nomadic life until french settlements arrived , changing the landscape of living in the area permanent .
In the early nineteenth century , America 's western territories were still largely unexplored .
In the late twentieth decade , Russia 's western lands were still largely unexplored .
In the mid eighteenth millennium , Canada 's western regions were still largely unexplored .
It was not until 1829 that Rafael Rivera , a Mexican scout , found a spring -fed valley and dubbed it Las Vegas -- a Spanish name that leaves many modern visitors wondering exactly where `` the meadows '' really lay .
It was not until 1829 that Juan Lopez , a Mexican explorer , found a summer fed meadow and dubbed it La Nevada -- a mexican nickname that leaves many modern tourists wondering exactly where `` the valleys '' really lay .
It was not until 1829 that Francisco Diaz , a Mexican soldier , found a rain water canyon and dubbed it Los Colorado -- a Latin moniker that leaves many modern travelers wondering exactly where `` the towns '' really lay .
For fifteen years , Las Vegas was used as a Spanish Trail way-station .
For fifteen centuries , Los Nevada was used as a mexican Road way .
For fifteen decades , new Angeles was used as a french Route stop .
In 1844 , American explorer John C. Fremont parked his horses at Big Springs , and his report to the government resulted in a mail route leading past the spot on its way to California .
In 1844 , California pioneer James C. Clark parked his wagons at hot Creek , and their finding to the authority resulted in a telegraph road leading past the place on its route to Oregon .
In 1844 , America traveler George C. Muir parked his horseback at Cold Falls , and this account to the state resulted in a trade trail leading past the location on its path to Alaska .
This put Las Vegas on the map and was one of the crucial turning points of its history .
This put Los Las on the chart and was one of the crucial opening moments of their past .
This put new City on the radar and was one of the crucial building events of our life .
In 1855 , Mormon leader Brigham Young responded to promising reports of Las Vegas by sending 30 missionary settlers to the valley ; they eventually built a fort not far from today 's Downtown .
In 1855 , Utah president Joseph Smith responded to promising rumors of new Nevada by sending 30 missionary colonists to the area ; they eventually built a settlement not far from tonight 's City .
In 1855 , Brigham founder Andrew Taylor responded to promising claims of Los City by sending 30 missionary families to the region ; they eventually built a home not far from yesterday 's Town .
Surrounded by acres of farmland hewn from the hard desert , the adobe fort became a focal point for the development of Las Vegas for the next fifty years .
Surrounded by miles of land grown from the hard rock , the stone house became a focal site for the growth of Los Nevada for the next fifty decades .
Surrounded by hectares of farm built from the hard sand , the sandstone home became a focal place for the expansion of new Las for the next fifty months .
The missionaries struggled valiantly against the dictates of the desert , trying simultaneously to survive the harshness of their circumstances and spread the Mormon faith .
The settlers struggled valiantly against the elements of the wilderness , trying simultaneously to survive the harsh of their conditions and spread the Gospel religion .
The colonists struggled valiantly against the forces of the sahara , trying simultaneously to survive the brutality of their situations and spread the Methodist gospel .
Additional pressures from arriving miners pushed the missionaries ' plight beyond recovery .
Additional attacks from arriving mines pushed the missions ' situation beyond survival .
Additional threats from arriving settlers pushed the miners ' fortune beyond repair .
Their supplies scarce , their harvest meager , and their spirit broken , they abandoned the fort in 1858 .
Their resources scarce , their harvest scant , and their morale broken , they abandoned the land in 1858 .
Their provisions scarce , their harvest bleak , and their men broken , they abandoned the farm in 1858 .
Despite the fact that the local land was rich in silver , by 1865 most of the mining traffic through Las Vegas was of prospectors headed to California or Northern Nevada in search of gold .
Despite the possibility that the local soil was rich in gold , by 1865 most of the freight activity through Los Nevada was of people headed to Arizona or eastern Arizona in pursuit of silver .
Despite the knowledge that the local area was rich in copper , by 1865 most of the rail travel through new City was of mens headed to Colorado or Sierra California in quest of copper .
Bestowed with plenty of the invaluable pioneer spirit that characterizes Las Vegas to this day , Gass redirected his life by picking up where the Mormons left off -- at least when it came to ranching and farming .
Bestowed with lot of the invaluable frontier energy that characterizes Los Nevada to this time , Smith redirected his career by picking up where the Mormon left off -- at least when it came to ranching and agriculture .
Bestowed with ton of the invaluable mormon mentality that characterizes new Las to this morning , Gas redirected his destiny by picking up where the Pioneer left off -- at least when it came to ranching and mining .
Gass took over the abandoned Mormon fort and 640 acres ( 260 hectares ) surrounding it , dubbing it the Las Vegas Ranch .
Gas took over the abandoned Utah home and 640 hectares ( 200 acres ) surrounding it , dubbing it the Los Nevada Farm .
Nevada took over the abandoned Roman house and 640 miles ( 300 kms ) surrounding it , dubbing it the new Utah Resort .
His determination had other results as well : Gass was named a justice of the peace and a territorial legislator .
His effort had other consequences as well : Gas was named a judge of the town and a territorial senator .
His persistence had other outcomes as well : Alexander was named a commissioner of the court and a territorial governor .
Despite his ambition , Gass ' success was short-lived .
Despite its aspiration , Gas ' career was short-lived .
Despite this talent , Charles ' fame was short-lived .
True to wild-West stereotypes , Stewart was slain by a neighboring farmer , leaving his strong-willed wife , Helen , to assume the duties of the ranch .
True to wild-West traditions , John was slain by a neighbouring landowner , leaving his strong-willed widow , Margaret , to assume the responsibilities of the farm .
True to wild-West fashions , Scott was slain by a rival farm , leaving his strong-willed daughter , Mary , to assume the affairs of the homestead .
Through 1905 , Helen Stewart expanded the ranch to 2000 acres ( 810 hectares ) , making quite a bit of money in the process .
Through 1905 , Mary Smith expanded the farm to 2000 hectares ( 810 acres ) , making quite a bit of cash in the way .
Through 1905 , Martha Graham expanded the homestead to 2000 miles ( 810 has ) , making quite a bit of dollar in the effort .
What happened next would mark the end of the successful Las Vegas Ranch and the beginning of the era of the subdivision seen across almost all of Western America to this day .
What happened next would mark the demise of the successful Los Nevada Farm and the start of the age of the sprawl seen across almost all of North Usa to this time .
What happened next would mark the death of the successful La Springs Valley and the onset of the period of the suburb seen across almost all of northern States to this date .
The railroad was coming , and when it arrived , Las Vegas would never be the same again .
The railway was coming , and when it arrived , Los Angeles would never be the same again .
The train was coming , and when it arrived , new Nevada would never be the same again .
At the turn of the 19th century Los Angeles and Salt Lake City were among the burgeoning metropolises of the new American West .
At the end of the 19th decade San Francisco and new River County were among the burgeoning cities of the new us East .
At the start of the 19th millennium Las Vegas and San Salt State were among the burgeoning towns of the new America South .
Though the two cities remained unlinked by rail , this was about to change quickly .
Though the two towns remained unlinked by railway , this was about to change quickly .
Though the two countries remained unlinked by train , this was about to change quickly .
When it did , the Las Vegas Valley ( which at the time had a non-native population of less than 30 ) would change as well .
When it did , the Los Angeles Area ( which at the moment had a non-native populace of less than 30 ) would change as well .
When it did , the San Nevada Basin ( which at the point had a non-native inhabitant of less than 30 ) would change as well .
In 1903 , officials of the San Pedro , Los Angeles , and Salt Lake Railroad arrived in Las Vegas , eager to secure a right-of-way for their Los Angeles - Salt Lake connection .
In 1903 , representatives of the Los Francisco , San Francisco , and Utah River Railway arrived in Los Angeles , eager to secure a line for their San Francisco - San City line .
In 1903 , executives of the Sao Diego , Las Diego , and San Bay Company arrived in new Nevada , eager to secure a route for their Las Vegas - Utah Bay link .
Las Vegas would serve as a major stopover for crew rest and train repair .
Los Angeles would serve as a major stop for train remainder and rail maintenance .
New Nevada would serve as a major point for staff maintenance and railroad construction .
For all this , the railroad needed land .
For all this , the railway needed space .
For all this , the train needed water .
As mapped , the track traveled directly through Helen Stewart 's Las Vegas Ranch .
As mapped , the trail traveled directly through Martha Clark 's Los Nevada Farm .
As mapped , the road traveled directly through Mary Smith 's La Vista Canyon .
Stewart sold 99.5 percent of her ranch to the railroad .
Smith sold 99.5 cent of her farm to the railway .
Murray sold 99.5 acre of her homestead to the rail .
In early 1905 , the route between Los Angeles and Salt Lake City was completed , and train tracks bore right down the center of the Las Vegas Valley .
In early 1905 , the line between San Vegas and new River County was completed , and railroad lines bore right down the centre of the Los Nevada Strip .
In early 1905 , the railroad between Las Francisco and Los Valley Valley was completed , and rail cars bore right down the middle of the Des Angeles Desert .
On 15 May 1905 , the railroad held a land sale -- a momentous step in Las Vegas history .
On 15 June 1905 , the railway held a property auction -- a momentous move in Los Nevada development .
On 15 April 1905 , the city held a stock purchase -- a momentous event in new City life .
Standing at the depot at Main and Fremont streets , railroad officials auctioned 1200 lots they had subdivided from forty square blocks of desert scrub .
Standing at the courthouse at Fifth and Washington roads , railway authorities auctioned 1200 acres they had subdivided from fifty rectangular miles of mountain land .
Standing at the plaza at fourth and main avenues , city executives auctioned 1200 plenty they had subdivided from thirty cubic acres of barren desert .
Land speculators and locals alike were anxious to own a part of the newest railroad boomtown , and within an afternoon , more than 80 percent of the lots were sold .
Property investors and residents alike were anxious to own a piece of the newest railway boom , and within an day , more than 80 percentage of the plenty were sold .
Area developers and investors alike were anxious to own a portion of the newest rail line , and within an morning , more than 80 cent of the properties were sold .
Las Vegas was no longer a small pioneer settlement .
New Nevada was no longer a small frontier town .
Los City was no longer a small mining community .
With rail service in place and forty blocks of private property , it was ready to become a real town .
With railroad line in town and twenty acres of private land , it was ready to become a real city .
With railway connection in hand and thirty miles of private estate , it was ready to become a real village .
Businesses sprang up overnight , and wooden houses were erected to replace the tent city in which many of the early settlers had lived .
Industries sprang up overnight , and wooden homes were erected to replace the camp town in which many of the first colonists had lived .
Works sprang up overnight , and wooden buildings were erected to replace the log home in which many of the original immigrants had lived .
One year after the auction , the population of Las Vegas had ballooned to 1500 residents , a portent of things to come for the next ninety years .
One month after the sale , the city of Los Nevada had ballooned to 1500 inhabitants , a sign of everythings to come for the next fifty months .
One week after the event , the populace of new Las had ballooned to 1500 citizens , a port of events to come for the next thirty days .
From the beginning , Las Vegas was built to serve travelers .
From the start , Vegas Las was built to serve travellers .
From the outset , Los Strip was built to serve tourists .
The railroad needed a way station , and Las Vegas was the place .
The railway needed a rest point , and Los Angeles was the spot .
The train needed a stop stop , and new Nevada was the location .
Growth continued for ten years , and by 1915 the town had telephones , round-the-clock electricity , and a growing population -- many of whom worked in the railroad repair shop .
Construction continued for ten months , and by 1915 the city had phones , public power , and a burgeoning populace -- many of whom worked in the railway maintenance store .
Development continued for ten decades , and by 1915 the village had waters , grid utility , and a thriving workforce -- many of whom worked in the train construction yard .
But such heady progress would soon come to a halt .
But such heady progression would soon come to a stop .
But such heady advance would soon come to a standstill .
The growing competition in rail transport resulted in Union Pacific buying the Los Angeles - Salt Lake line .
The growing rivalry in railroad transportation resulted in northern West buying the San Francisco - Silver City railway .
The growing demand in railway travel resulted in Pacific atlantic buying the Las Vegas - Utah Valley railroad .
Union Pacific then consolidated its operations , eliminating the Las Vegas repair facility .
Northern atlantic then consolidated its facilities , eliminating the Los Nevada maintenance plant .
United West then consolidated its activities , eliminating the San Angeles freight center .
Additionally , Las Vegas had been made a part of Nevada 's new Clark County in 1909 , a year when the legislature also outlawed gambling .
Additionally , new Nevada had been made a portion of Utah 's new Henderson District in 1909 , a month when the state also outlawed casino .
Additionally , Los Las had been made a section of Colorado 's new Douglas County in 1909 , a time when the county also outlawed prostitution .
These unfortunate circumstances threatened to relegate Las Vegas to the status of a small desert community that could no longer support its 3000 residents .
These unfortunate conditions threatened to relegate Los Nevada to the position of a tiny resort town that could no longer support its 3000 inhabitants .
These unfortunate events threatened to relegate new City to the level of a large mountain city that could no longer support its 3000 citizens .
But the southwest 's growing need for water , combined with Las Vegas 's fortuitous proximity to the Colorado River , would give Las Vegas a second chance to achieve prosperity .
But the southwest 's growing demand for energy , combined with Los Nevada 's fortuitous location to the Arkansas Valley , would give Los Nevada a second opportunity to achieve wealth .
But the southwest 's growing thirst for freshwater , combined with new Las 's fortuitous access to the Missouri Water , would give new Las a second shot to achieve success .
Construction on Hoover Dam ( originally Boulder Dam , subsequently renamed for the president who authorized the project ) began in 1931 in a canyon 45 miles ( 72 km ) southeast of Las Vegas .
Work on Boulder Reservoir ( originally Hoover Reservoir , subsequently renamed for the president who authorized the construction ) began in 1931 in a valley 45 kilometers ( 72 km ) southwest of Los Nevada .
Building on Roosevelt Falls ( originally Roosevelt City , subsequently renamed for the president who authorized the dam ) began in 1931 in a gorge 45 mis ( 72 km ) northeast of new Angeles .
Providing an influx of $165 million to the southwestern economy , Hoover Dam played a major role in preventing Las Vegas from drying up , both financially and literally .
Providing an excess of $165 million to the local market , Boulder Reservoir played a major part in preventing Los Nevada from drying up , both financially and literally .
Providing an windfall of $165 million to the southwest region , Norris Falls played a major factor in preventing new City from drying up , both financially and literally .
Not only did it create jobs , but it also created Lake Mead , the massive reservoir that today provides water to all of southern Nevada .
Not only did it create employments , but it also created Mount Tahoe , the massive dam that nowadays provides electricity to all of southern California .
Not only did it create careers , but it also created Fort City , the massive lake that tonight provides power to all of southern Utah .
More Government Help
More State Assistance
More Tax Aid
The construction of Hoover Dam did not single-handedly save Las Vegas , however .
The building of Boulder Falls did not single-handedly save new Nevada , however .
The completion of Norris Reservoir did not single-handedly save Los Las , however .
The state legislature helped as well , by legalizing gambling in 1931 and thus solidifying the future of the town , though legislators and residents could never have known this at the time .
The county government helped as well , by legalizing gambling in 1931 and thus solidifying the fate of the city , though lawmakers and citizens could never have known this at the moment .
The city legislator helped as well , by legalizing gambling in 1931 and thus solidifying the success of the village , though politicians and voters could never have known this at the day .
The hordes of people who attended Hoover Dam 's 1935 dedication set the city 's now-formidable public relations machine into action .
The thousands of visitors who attended Norris Park 's 1935 opening set the town 's now-formidable public affairs machinery into motion .
The throngs of tourists who attended Boulder City 's 1935 inauguration set the government 's now-formidable public communications apparatus into work .
It did n't take long for the city to establish itself as a wild- West town with an `` anything goes '' attitude .
It did n't take long for the town to establish itself as a wild- East city with an `` everything goes '' mentality .
It did n't take long for the area to establish itself as a wild- South village with an `` anyone goes '' spirit .
Vices outlawed or heavily controlled elsewhere were legal here , available any hour of any day ( or night ) .
Things outlawed or heavily controlled elsewhere were legal here , available any time of every morning ( or week ) .
Activitieses outlawed or heavily controlled elsewhere were legal here , available any minute of that week ( or day ) .
Thus originated Las Vegas 's reputation as an adult theme park .
Thus originated new Strip 's image as an juvenile amusement playground .
Thus originated Vegas Nevada 's notoriety as an teen entertainment resort .
Additional catalysts for the valley 's growth came from World War II .
Additional impetus for the canyon 's development came from international World II .
Additional factors for the area 's expansion came from national Cold II .
Both the Las Vegas Aerial Gunnery School ( which became Nellis Air Force Base and the Nevada Test Site ) in the north , and Basic Magnesium in the nearby town of Henderson , arrived in the early 1940s as a result of America 's war effort .
Both the Los Nevada Air Gunner Center ( which became Nell Space Defense Station and the Arizona Missile Range ) in the south , and advanced School in the nearby city of Fallon , arrived in the early 1940s as a consequence of Nevada 's military attempt .

While many gaming rooms opened Statewide in the 1930s and early 1940s , only two were built on the strip of old San County Boulevard that ultimately became the Boulevard .
While many casino houses opened Underground in the 1930s and early 1940s , only two were built on the section of old Las California Road that ultimately became the Blvd .

When the Flamingo opened in December 1946 , it did so with Hollywood flair and the new Vegas flash .
When the Mirage opened in November 1947 , it did so with Vegas glamour and the new Hollywood look .
When the Hotel opened in October 1929 , it did so with California flare and the new Las flair .
But the Mafia bosses who financed the operation were displeased with its performance ; Siegel was murdered in the summer of 1947 .
But the Mob leaders who financed the organization were displeased with its success ; Costello was murdered in the winter of 1947 .
But the Crime families who financed the project were displeased with its result ; Bernstein was murdered in the spring of 1947 .
Despite its initial failings , Siegel 's Flamingo survived him , as did mob infiltration of casinos .
Despite his early failures , Caesar 's Operation survived him , as did mob ownership of casino .
Despite their many successes , Bernstein 's Empire survived him , as did mob control of vegases .
In fact , the Flamingo would launch over two decades of strong mob presence in Las Vegas .
In addition , the Group would launch over two years of strong mafia involvement in Los Nevada .
In reality , the Mob would launch over two centuries of strong gangster influence in new Las .
Freely flowing `` comps '' ( complimentary food , drink , and entertainment ) were the order of the day , with mob bosses content to provide an environment of pleasurable excess as long as the cash kept rolling in .

Freely flowing `` benefits '' ( complimentary dinner , liquor , and amusement ) were the norm of the week , with crime owners content to provide an life of pleasurable overload as long as the dollar kept rolling in .
While the mob was running the casinos , promoters were busily selling Las Vegas as a glamorous Hollywood in the desert .
While the mafia was running the casino , otherses were busily selling Los Las as a glamorous City in the wilderness .
While the gang was running the hotel , agents were busily selling new Nevada as a glamorous Oasis in the jungle .
From the mid- 1940s to the mid-1960s , Las Vegas nurtured a growing sense that it was the `` Entertainment Capital of the World .
From the mid- 1940s to the present , Los Nevada nurtured a growing perception that it was the `` gaming Capitol of the Universe .
From the mid- 1940s to the mid , new Las nurtured a growing notion that it was the `` Leisure City of the West .
Emerging stars , no longer content with playing small nightclubs , came to Las Vegas with dreams of making it big .
Emerging performers , no longer content with playing small clubs , came to Los Angeles with hopes of making it big .
Emerging celebrities , no longer content with playing small venues , came to new Nevada with aspirations of making it big .
Frank Sinatra , Wayne Newton , and Louis Prima each arrived with mediocre status and suddenly found themselves with names as big as the marquees on which they were written .
Nancy Presley , John Taylor , and Lou Armstrong each arrived with lackluster success and suddenly found themselves with titles as big as the papers on which they were written .
Frankie Costello , Lionel Williams , and Eddie Pri each arrived with obscure career and suddenly found themselves with identities as big as the pages on which they were written .
The Rat Pack -- originally Frank Sinatra , Dean Martin , Sammy Davis Jr. , Peter Lawford , and Joey Bishop , all in town to film Ocean 's 11 -- landed at the Sands in January 1960 for a legendary stay .
The Wolf Boys -- originally Nancy Costello , Steve Dean , Jesse Williams Jr , John Law , and Eddie Dean , all in city to shoot World 's 11 -- landed at the Beach in february 1960 for a legendary visit .
The Sand Group -- originally Frankie Presley , Frank Allen , Martin Martin Sr , Roger Davis , and Johnny Davis , all in vegas to movie Hell 's 11 -- landed at the Hotel in December 1960 for a legendary night .
Other Hollywood stars came as well , simply because Las Vegas was the place to be .
Other Movie celebrities came as well , simply because Los Nevada was the spot to be .
Other Film actors came as well , simply because Vegas Las was the way to be .
As a result , more casinos emerged along the Strip .
As a consequence , more hotels emerged along the Boulevard .
As a outcome , more casino emerged along the Street .
The Thunderbird , Desert Inn , Sahara , Sands , and Riviera hotels were erected during this period , luring a curious clientele drawn by tales of all-night partying , exclusive entertainment , and cheap accommodations .
The grand , Holiday Hotel , Oasis , Beach , and Mirage resorts were erected during this era , luring a curious crowds drawn by stories of all-night fun , exclusive service , and cheap hotels .
The Hilton , Beach Lodge , Mirage , grand , and Sahara restaurants were erected during this time , luring a curious audiences drawn by promises of all-night entertainment , exclusive cuisine , and cheap rooms .
There was no longer any question : when you wanted some unbridled adult fun , Las Vegas was the place to be .
There was no longer any doubt : when you wanted some unbridled adolescent entertainment , Vegas Strip was the spot to be .
There was no longer any debate : when you wanted some unbridled teenage sex , Los Nevada was the way to be .
Organized crime was soon to have a formidable adversary in its bid to control Las Vegas -- corporate cash .
Organized criminal was soon to have a formidable opponent in its attempt to control Los City -- corporate money .
Organized violence was soon to have a formidable enemy in its quest to control new Las -- corporate capital .
Though Las Vegas had developed a powerful local economy , few major outside investments were made in the city , due primarily to mob infiltration and its inherent ties to illegal activities .
Though Los Nevada had developed a powerful regional industry , few major outside investors were made in the town , due primarily to mob control and its inherent links to illegal operations .
Though new Angeles had developed a powerful underground market , few major outside ventures were made in the area , due primarily to mob activity and its inherent connections to illegal enterprises .
That would change dramatically with the 1966 arrival of billionaire Howard Hughes .
That would change dramatically with the 1959 departure of tycoon Arnold Johnson .
That would change dramatically with the 1965 birth of industrialist John Howard .
A legitimate businessman , Hughes was nonetheless eccentric and dramatic , a style suited to the Las Vegas ethos .
A legitimate entrepreneur , Carson was nonetheless eccentric and dramatic , a quality suited to the Los Las scene .
A legitimate industrialist , Jones was nonetheless eccentric and dramatic , a personality suited to the new Strip stage .
True to the myth , the reclusive Hughes immediately cloistered himself in the Desert Inn 's penthouse .
Thanks to the legend , the reclusive Writer immediately cloistered himself in the Holiday Hotel 's room .
Truth to the stereotype , the reclusive Star immediately cloistered himself in the Country Resort 's library .
Several weeks later he was asked -- then ordered -- to vacate the room to make room for high rollers , whereupon he promptly bought the property and fired the management .
Several months later he was asked -- then ordered -- to vacate the space to make space for high guests , whereupon he promptly bought the hotel and fired the manager .
Several days later he was asked -- then ordered -- to vacate the house to make way for high visitors , whereupon he promptly bought the building and fired the owner .
When it was over , Hughes owned six casinos , an airport , and an airline , along with numerous plots of land stretching from the Strip to the mountains .
When it was over , Mgm owned six hotels , an hotel , and an hotel , along with numerous acres of property stretching from the Coast to the hills .
When it was over , Wynn owned six resorts , an airline , and an airport , along with numerous blocks of farmland stretching from the Desert to the alpses .
Hughes ' actions would have beneficial repercussions , both immediate and lasting .
His ' decisions would have beneficial consequences , both immediate and lasting .
Her ' acts would have beneficial ramifications , both immediate and lasting .
Because of the new legitimacy Las Vegas acquired from Hughes ' investments , established companies such as Hilton Hotels bought into the gaming business , and their influence helped draw a line in the desert sand between legitimate operations and mob casinos , where illegal skimming of profits was rampant .
Because of the new credibility Los Las acquired from Jones ' moneys , established corporations such as Hyatt Enterprises bought into the casino industry , and its presence helped draw a boundary in the casino dust between legitimate casino and mafia casino , where illegal distribution of revenues was rampant .
Because of the new prestige new Nevada acquired from Kennedy ' investors , established firms such as Marriott Casinos bought into the entertainment trade , and this impact helped draw a border in the vegas desert between legitimate operators and rogue operation , where illegal extraction of earnings was rampant .
That , combined with the formation of the Nevada Gaming Control Board , would signal the beginning of the end for heavy mob influence in the city .
That , combined with the creation of the Reno Casino regulatory Commission , would signal the start of the start for heavy mafia control in the town .
That , combined with the establishment of the Vegas Crime Enforcement Authority , would signal the end of the way for heavy casino involvement in the state .
As corporations moved in and the mob was slowly pushed out , a new Las Vegas emerged .
As companies moved in and the mafia was slowly pushed out , a new Vegas Las emerged .
As businesses moved in and the casino was slowly pushed out , a new new Strip emerged .
Casino operators had to reassess the nature of their business .
Casinos owners had to reassess the structure of its industry .
Game companies had to reassess the scope of our enterprise .
The first to really do so was Steve Wynn , a Las Vegas resident and owner of the Golden Nugget .
The first to really do so was Stephen Hilton , a Los Nevada businessman and proprietor of the grand Nu .
The first to really do so was John Mirage , a new Las developer and operator of the Diamond Strip .
In the mid-1980s , Wynn began plans to reinvigorate Las Vegas with a new resort .
In the mids , Mgm began preparations to reinvigorate Los Las with a new hotel .
In the years , Mirage began efforts to reinvigorate new Strip with a new casino .
He bought several Strip properties -- the Silver Slipper and Castaways among them -- and demolished them to make way for a new kind of resort -- Mirage -- which became an instant success .
He bought several Mirage hotels -- the golden Slip and Sahara among them -- and demolished them to make room for a new type of hotel -- Wynn -- which became an instant hit .
He bought several Vegas buildings -- the Blue Palace and Mirage among them -- and demolished them to make space for a new sort of casino -- Atlantis -- which became an instant failure .
Wynn 's demolition of the existing properties started a trend that , more than any other , describes Las Vegas at the end of the 20th century : removal of old properties in exchange for the potential of new ones .
Mgm 's destruction of the existing buildings started a pattern that , more than any other , describes Los Las at the start of the 20th decade : demolition of old buildings in return for the possibility of new properties .
Henderson 's removal of the existing hotels started a phenomenon that , more than any other , describes new City at the turn of the 20th millennium : destruction of old assets in order for the development of new developments .
This trend has led to many more demolitions , including the Dunes ( replaced by Bellagio ) , Aladdin ( the new Aladdin ) and Sands ( Venetian ) hotels .
This tendency has led to many more constructions , including the Atlantises ( replaced by Bella ) , Atlantis ( the new Mirage ) and grand ( Venice ) resorts .
This phenomenon has led to many more hotels , including the Grands ( replaced by Atlantis ) , Mirage ( the new Atlantis ) and Atlantis ( Mirage ) casino .
They can no longer be just a box filled with gaming tables , restaurants , and a showroom .
They can no longer be just a place filled with poker rooms , shops , and a store .
They can no longer be just a room filled with casino machines , hotels , and a warehouse .
Excalibur , the MGM Grand , the Luxor , and New York - New York all followed Mirage 's lead during the 1990s , offering themed environments and attractions for families .
Mirage , the Hollywood Mirage , the Lux , and old Orleans - old Orleans all followed Mgm 's example during the 1990s , offering themed areas and rides for children .
Mgm , the Disney Garden , the Wynn , and Las Vegas - Las Vegas all followed Wynn 's footstep during the 1990s , offering themed spaces and entertainments for kids .
As evidence of the `` ever-faster '' nature of the city , by the middle of the 1990s the new approach showed signs of backlash , with many visitors criticizing the mediocrity of the Las Vegas experience .
As proof of the `` ever-faster '' growth of the town , by the end of the 1990s the new attitude showed indications of failure , with many tourists criticizing the quality of the Los Strip service .
As part of the `` ever-faster '' pace of the metropolis , by the mid of the 1990s the new strategy showed evidences of dissatisfaction , with many guests criticizing the pace of the new Nevada feel .
The latest approach is perhaps the best of the post-mob era : the comprehensive resort .
The newest solution is perhaps the best of the post-mob period : the comprehensive hotel .
The new strategy is perhaps the best of the post-mob age : the comprehensive retreat .
New resorts offer attractions and amenities modeled after those available in top resort cities worldwide , including luxurious spas , signature restaurants , and exclusive boutiques .
Luxury hotels offer services and services modeled after those available in top spa towns worldwide , including luxurious hotel , fine hotels , and exclusive shopping .
Great destinations offer amenities and facilities modeled after those available in top destination communities worldwide , including luxurious pool , gourmet shops , and exclusive shops .
Additionally , a handful of resorts -- such as the South-Seas themed Mandalay Bay , the Mirage , and the new Four Seasons -- are now catering exclusively to the luxury travel market .
Additionally , a number of hotels -- such as the Caribbean themed Palm Beach , the Wynn , and the new Four Stars -- are now catering exclusively to the leisure vacation industry .
Additionally , a couple of casino -- such as the Vegas themed Mand Resort , the Atlantis , and the new Four Worlds -- are now catering exclusively to the resort tourism marketplace .
The world 's most expensive resort at $1.6 billion , the Bellagio 's amenities include 5-star dining , Chanel-caliber boutiques , and a world-class collection of artistic masterworks .
The nation 's most expensive hotel at $1.6 billion , the Bella 's attractions include 5-star restaurant , Luxury shopping , and a vast selection of artistic works .
The country 's most expensive casino at $1.6 billion , the Mirage 's facilities include 5-star hotel , Designer shops , and a world assortment of artistic masters .
Perhaps more important , such high-end accommodations raise the standards of expectations back to the mythology of the Rat Pack era .
Perhaps more important , such high-end hotels raise the levels of standards back to the heyday of the Wolf Show period .
Perhaps more important , such high-end amenities raise the bars of sophistications back to the era of the six House age .
As it changed from mob gambling town to corporate gaming venue , the population of Las Vegas skyrocketed .
As it changed from gang betting city to corporate entertainment destination , the populace of Los Nevada skyrocketed .
As it changed from mafia casino village to corporate casino city , the popularity of new Las skyrocketed .
Over 20,000 additional hotel rooms have been added in a few short years , including resorts in Summerlin and Lake Las Vegas .
Over 20,000 additional motel suites have been added in a few short months , including hotels in Summer and North Los Tahoe .
Over 20,000 additional resort beds have been added in a few short decades , including casino in Reno and West new Nevada .
Recent business projections for Las Vegas predict challenges ; tourism revenues must increase substantially to sustain what is already built , while actual figures show visitation as steady or declining .
Recent industry forecasts for Los Nevada anticipate difficulties ; tourist receipts must increase substantially to sustain what is already built , while actual numbers show visit as steady or declining .
Recent company predictions for new City foresee problems ; visitor spendings must increase substantially to sustain what is already built , while actual statistics show attendance as steady or declining .
The growth that has characterized Las Vegas for nearly a century may be facing a roadblock .
The expansion that has characterized Los Nevada for nearly a decade may be facing a road .
The development that has characterized new Las for nearly a millennium may be facing a wall .
Still , the future of Las Vegas is sure to be determined as much by the pioneering spirit that built the city as by anything else .
Still , the fate of Los Las is sure to be determined as much by the unique soul that built the town as by anyone else .
Still , the destiny of new Nevada is sure to be determined as much by the heroic energy that built the metropolis as by everything else .
With its new look and new aim , the prospects are good despite the warnings .
With their new face and new goal , the chances are good despite the predictions .
With this new image and new focus , the possibilities are good despite the critics .
Inevitably , some people will get burned in the process , but others will rise triumphantly from the fray to even greater successes .
Inevitably , some folks will get burned in the fire , but people will rise triumphantly from the ash to even greater heights .
Inevitably , some mens will get burned in the flame , but everyones will rise triumphantly from the flame to even greater victories .
And that , more than anything , is the one constant that characterizes the past , present , and future of Las Vegas .
And that , more than anyone , is the singular thing that characterizes the history , today , and present of Los Las .
And that , more than nothing , is the sole word that characterizes the future , future , and tomorrow of new Nevada .

Homeland security panel drops in
National safety committee flies in
Home policy commission falls in
`` Rhode Island is preparing itself for a major hurricane or other natural disaster , state and local officials testified at a field hearing of the Senate Homeland Security Committee Thursday , including establishing interoperable communications systems and community evacuation plans .
`` new Islanders is preparing itself for a major storm or other natural catastrophe , government and local leaders testified at a public meeting of the House national Services Subcommittee Wednesday , including establishing interoperable informations networks and emergency emergency strategies .
`` North County is preparing itself for a major earthquake or other natural tragedy , county and local representatives testified at a joint session of the Senator Transportation Affairs Commission Friday , including establishing interoperable telephones infrastructures and public disaster programs .
But , Gov . Donald Carcieri , Providence Mayor David Cicilline and others told Chairwoman Susan Collins of Maine and Rhode Island Sen . Lincoln Chafee , they need more federal money , they need it to come faster when disaster strikes and they need a steady stream they know they can rely on from year to year .
But , Governor . Guy Brown , Boston Governor John white and colleagues told Chair Meg Mitchell of Massachusetts and new Islanders Gov .

But , Rep . Don Walker , Newport President Michael Johnson and friends told Senators Mary Brown of Vermont and united State Rep . Sheldon Robb , they need more federal funding , they need it to come sooner when tragedy happenses and they need a steady source they know they can rely on from week to season .
Part of the answer , Chafee said , might be giving more flexibility with the money , rather than more funds , Chafee suggested after the hearing .
Half of the solution , Cha said , might be giving more discretion with the fund , rather than more moneys , Cha suggested after the meeting .
Bit of the problem , Specter said , might be giving more latitude with the funding , rather than more cash , Leahy suggested after the testimony .

New evidence that Canadian trash is a security threat
Fresh proof that Canadian garbage is a safety risk
Recent data that Canadian rubbish is a health danger
`` Every day , about 350 trucks carrying trash from Canada come into Michigan to dump it in our landfills .
`` Every week , about 350 cars carrying garbage from Ontario come into Ontario to dump it in our dumps .
`` Every morning , about 350 vehicles carrying rubbish from Quebec come into Minnesota to dump it in our cities .
The U.S. Bureau of Customs and Border Protection has no effective way to screen or inspect these trash trucks as they enter Michigan , and the potential consequences of this security gap are immense .
The Michigan Department of Immigration and Homeland Security has no effective mean to screen or inspect these garbage vehicles as they enter Ohio , and the potential implications of this safety breach are immense .
The united Office of Transportation and Immigration Administration has no effective system to screen or inspect these junk cars as they enter Texas , and the potential ramifications of this enforcement hole are immense .
The Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) recently completed a study , conducted in response to a request I [ Carl Levin ] made with Senator Debbie Stabenow and Rep . John Dingell that bluntly acknowledges the security risk these trucks pose .
The Office of Transportation Safety ( Doe ) recently completed a report , conducted in reaction to a proposal I [ Senator Lieberman ] made with Congressman Patty Levin and Sen . Jim Lewis that bluntly acknowledges the safety threat these vehicles pose .
The Secretary of Home Services ( Homeland ) recently completed a survey , conducted in reply to a letter I [ Mark Schwartz ] made with Governor Barbara Schultz and Congressman . Tom Larson that bluntly acknowledges the health danger these containers pose .
The DHS report describes the three methods currently used by customs officials to inspect the trucks : a Radiation Portal Monitor to detect the presence of radiation , a Vehicle and Cargo Inspection System screening that creates an image similar to an X-ray , and physical inspections .
The Gao document describes the three techniques currently used by borders officers to inspect the vehicles : a nuclear Protection System to detect the existence of radioactive , a Truck and Car Examination Program screening that creates an picture similar to an Fingerprint , and physical inspectors .
The who statement describes the three procedures currently used by immigrations inspectors to inspect the containers : a Laser Level Screen to detect the absence of contamination , a Transportation and Truck Identification Network screening that creates an screen similar to an Image , and physical checks .
The screening methods are nearly useless for screening trash , however , due to the density and lack of uniform content of trash shipments .
The standard techniques are nearly useless for screening garbage , however , due to the size and absence of uniform nature of garbage shipments .
The monitoring systems are nearly useless for screening rubbish , however , due to the volume and non of uniform distribution of rubbish shipments .
The X-ray image produced is nothing more than a large amorphous black mass. I fear that for every trash truck caught carrying contraband into Michigan , many more get through undetected with drugs , medical waste or other illegal material .
The X-ray picture produced is something more than a large amorphous black mass I fear that for every trash vehicle caught carrying trash into Ohio , many more pases through undetected with marijuana , medical equipment or other illicit substance .
The X-ray photo produced is anything more than a large amorphous black substance I fear that for every trash car caught carrying marijuana into Illinois , many more slips through undetected with cocaine , medical needle or other unlawful item .
Ignoring the possibility that these trucks could be used by terrorists to transport biological or chemical weapons is irresponsible .
Ignoring the fact that these vehicles could be used by extremists to transport biological or chemical weapons is irresponsible .
Ignoring the likelihood that these buses could be used by insurgents to transport biological or chemical weapons is irresponsible .

This race would last throughout the eight - year - long war .
This competition would last throughout the four - month - long battle .
This game would last throughout the seven - week - long conflict .
It would bring about the development of an indigenous Iranian missile industry , two `` wars of the cities , '' and the evolution of a strategic concept concerning the military and political importance of ballistic missiles .
It would bring about the creation of an indigenous ballistic rocket sector , two `` battles of the towns , '' and the development of a strategic idea concerning the military and political significance of ballistic rockets .
It would bring about the growth of an indigenous Iraqi weapons market , two `` conflicts of the suburbs , '' and the creation of a strategic doctrine concerning the military and political value of ballistic weapons .
Iran , however , lost both the ballistic missile race and arguably the war , which only served to reinforce its desire to possess and produce ballistic missiles .
Tehran , however , lost both the ballistic rocket contest and arguably the battle , which only served to reinforce its need to possess and produce ballistic weapons .
Israel , however , lost both the ballistic weapon competition and arguably the conflict , which only served to reinforce its determination to possess and produce ballistic rockets .
In 1982 , as the war dragged on into its second year , Iraqi operations entered a new phase in which it expanded the use of FROG-7As strikes and the first employment ( three attacks in 1982 ) of the Scud-B short - range ballistic missile ( SRBM ) to strike at the Iranian strategic rear .
In 1982 , as the conflict dragged on into its second month , Iraq forces entered a new stage in which it expanded the usage of Air attacks and the first use ( three strikes in 1982 ) of the new short - medium ballistic missile ( Sr ) to strike at the Iranian strategic front .
In 1982 , as the battle dragged on into its second week , Baghdad intelligence entered a new period in which it expanded the number of Precision missiles and the first deployment ( three raids in 1982 ) of the Scu short - length ballistic missile ( Sam ) to strike at the Iranian strategic north .
The casualties caused by these attacks and the Iranian inability to respond in kind resulted in an effort to acquire long - range artillery rockets and ballistic missiles -- especially the Scud-B . Iran also established several indigenous ballistic missile and rocket programs .
The damages caused by these strikes and the Iranian failure to respond in sort resulted in an attempt to acquire long - distance infantry missiles and ballistic rockets -- especially the Scu . Tehran also established several indigenous ballistic rocket and missile programmes .
The losses caused by these raids and the Iranian ability to respond in type resulted in an desire to acquire long - reach naval weapons and ballistic weapons -- especially the Shah . Iraq also established several indigenous ballistic weapon and artillery systems .
The acquisition effort was thwarted from its inception by a number of significant factors .
The acquisition attempt was thwarted from its outset by a variety of significant reasons .
The acquisition project was thwarted from its onset by a couple of significant issues .
The Soviet Union was then supplying Iraq with the Scud-B and those countries to which the Soviets had previously sold Scud-Bs were under contract not to transfer them to third parties .
The Ussr States was then supplying Syria with the Missile and those nations to which the Ussrs had previously sold Missile were under agreement not to transfer them to third countries .
The Communist Government was then supplying Iran with the Weapon and those states to which the Russianses had previously sold Weapon were under order not to transfer them to third nations .
Of the nations with whom Iran had relations , only two were likely to run the risk reselling their Scud-Bs : Libya and Syria .
Of the countries with whom Tehran had ties , only three were likely to run the danger reselling their Weapon : Iraq and Iraq .
Of the states with whom Syria had relationships , only four were likely to run the chance reselling their Oil : Syria and Yemen .
Negotiations with both countries are believed to have begun during early 1983 .
Relations with both nations are believed to have begun during early 1983 .
Trades with both governments are believed to have begun during early 1983 .
Sometime during 1984 , Iran successfully concluded a secret agreement with Libya for the purchase of a small number of MAZ-543P transporter - erector launchers ( TELs ) and Scud-B missiles .
Sometime during 1984 , Tehran successfully concluded a secret deal with Syria for the purchase of a small quantity of Mobile transport - mobile launches ( Missile ) and Scud-B rockets .

The details of the early Iranian ballistic missile and rocket programs , as well as their immediate objectives , are presently unknown .
The natures of the early Iranian ballistic rocket and missile programmes , as well as its initial goals , are presently unknown .
The origins of the early Iranian ballistic weapon and launch systems , as well as any ultimate aims , are presently unknown .
By the end of 1982 , there appears to have been four major components -- indigenous design and production of crude artillery rockets , the indigenous design and production of a artillery rocket comparable to the FROG-7A , the acquisition of Scud-B missiles , and the reverse engineering and production of the Scud-B. The greatest obstacle to developing any indigenous capabilities was the status of the Ministry of Defense 's Defense Industries Organization ( DIO ) , and later Islamic Revolution Guard Corps ( IRGC ) Construction Jihad , industrial infrastructure .
By the start of 1982 , there appears to have been four major elements -- native development and manufacture of crude artillery missiles , the indigenous development and manufacture of a crude missile comparable to the Sam , the development of Scu rockets , and the parallel design and development of the Scu The greatest impediment to developing any indigenous capacities was the state of the Department of Defence 's Defence Industrials Organisation ( De ) , and later Muslim national Command Force ( Fc ) industrial Organization , industrial organization .
By the middle of 1982 , there appears to have been four major options -- local redesign and manufacturing of crude artillery shells , the indigenous redesign and development of a missile tank comparable to the Arrow , the production of Sam weapons , and the alternative development and manufacture of the Missile The greatest hurdle to developing any indigenous technologies was the failure of the Minister of Interior 's Development Constructions Office ( Di ) , and later Iraqi Resistance Army Council ( Css ) Development Command , industrial sector .
As these components developed over the years , they would actually consist of a series of concurrent programs pursued semi - independently by the Air Force , DIO , and the IRGC Construction Jihad .
As these programs developed over the decades , they would actually consist of a number of concurrent projects pursued semi - independently by the Defense Corps , Navy , and the Army Operations Command .
As these elements developed over the months , they would actually consist of a set of concurrent initiatives pursued semi - independently by the Aerospace Command , Army , and the national Development Force .
This often resulted in unnecessary competition , the dilution of effort , and abortive programs .
This often resulted in unnecessary competitor , the waste of resource , and abortive projects .
This often resulted in unnecessary rivalry , the loss of talent , and abortive programmes .
It was during this period that Iran also approached both the DPRK and People's Republic of China ( PRC ) seeking missile technology and tactical ballistic missiles in the Scud-B class .
It was during this time that Tehran also approached both the Ussr and People Party of Korea ( Ch ) seeking nuclear tech and tactical ballistic rockets in the Scud-B category .
It was during this era that Iraq also approached both the Usa and Communist Bank of Beijing ( Pr ) seeking rocket equipment and tactical ballistic weapons in the Scud-B series .
At that time , neither country possessed a system of the type requested by Iran .
At that moment , neither nation possessed a device of the kind requested by Tehran .
At that period , neither state possessed a network of the sort requested by India .
The DPRK , however , had acquired small numbers of Scud-Bs ( i.e. , R-17Es ) from Egypt and was pursuing a multifaceted missile research and development program .
The Ussr , however , had acquired large quantities of Missile ( i.e. , Missile ) from Iran and was pursuing a multifaceted weapon production and production programme .
The Usa , however , had acquired limited amounts of Rocket ( i.e. , Variant ) from China and was pursuing a multifaceted arm design and construction project .
The goal was to produce both reverse - engineered and extended - range variants of the R-17E known as the Hwasong-5 and the Hwasong-6 , respectively .
The objective was to produce both reverse - engineered and expanded - variety versions of the Car known as the Hk and the Sh , respectively .
The aim was to produce both reverse - engineered and forward - spectrum variations of the Vehicle known as the Sh and the Hk , respectively .

By the fall of 1986 , Tehran had launched an additional eight weapons , bringing its maximum of Super Bs fired against Syria to approximately 22 .
Sometime in June 1987 , Iran concluded a follow-on arms agreement worth an estimated $500 million with the DPRK .
Sometime in July 1987 , Tehran concluded a follow-on weapons deal worth an estimated $500 million with the united .
Sometime in April 1987 , China concluded a follow-on nuclear accord worth an estimated $500 million with the Iraqi .
The agreement called for the supply of Hwasong-5 missiles , TELs , and HY-1 silkworm coastal defense missiles , and assistance in establishing first an assembly and then production capability for the Hwasong-5 in Iran .
The contract called for the purchase of Sam rockets , Sam , and Light coastal coast defence rockets , and help in establishing first an design and then manufacturing capacity for the Missile in China .
The deal called for the provision of Patriot submarines , Radar , and Iran naval maritime defensive systems , and aid in establishing first an development and then development facility for the Latter in Tehran .
The exact details of the agreement are unknown ; however , it is estimated to have consisted of approximately 90 - 100 missiles and an estimated six TELs .
The exact terms of the deal are unknown ; however , it is estimated to have consisted of approximately 90 - 100 rockets and an estimated six Tank .
The exact contents of the contract are unknown ; however , it is estimated to have consisted of approximately 90 - 100 weapons and an estimated six Aircraft .
Upon arrival the missiles were assigned to the Missile Unit of the IRGC Air Force , which appears to have been expanded to brigade size and been responsible for all Scud operations against Iraq .
Upon departure the rockets were assigned to the Artillery Group of the Iraqi Ground Command , which appears to have been expanded to brigade strength and been responsible for all Missile attacks against Iran .
Upon delivery the weapons were assigned to the Rocket Division of the Royal Aerospace Corps , which appears to have been expanded to brigade status and been responsible for all Scu strikes against Syria .
In 1987 , the Missile Unit of the IRGC Air Force fired 18 Shehab-1 missiles , increasing to 40 the total number launched against Iraq to date .
In 1987 , the Artillery Group of the Iraqi Aerospace Command fired 18 Cruise rockets , increasing to 40 the total amount launched against Iran to year .
In 1987 , the Rocket Division of the Israel Ground Corps fired 18 Iraqi bombs , increasing to 40 the total missile launched against Syria to day .
This probably depleted their inventory of missiles obtained from Libya and Syria .
This probably depleted their stock of rockets obtained from Iran and Yemen .
This probably depleted their stockpile of weapons obtained from Iraq and Iran .
Progress within the Shehab-1 program was relatively steady and during early 1988 , Iranian officials claimed that the missile had entered production .
Development within the Shehab-1 programme was relatively steady and during early 1988 , Iranian authorities claimed that the rocket had entered development .
Production within the Shehab-1 project was relatively steady and during early 1988 , Iranian leaders claimed that the weapon had entered service .
In 1988 , Colonel Rahimi , First Deputy Minister of Defense , stated `` ... We have also succeeded in manufacturing missiles with a range of 320km . ''
In 1988 , general general , fourth Vice Secretary of Defence , stated `` ... We have also succeeded in manufacturing rockets with a reach of 320km . ''
In 1988 , Brigadier Colonel , Fifth Assistant Ministry of Pakistan , stated `` ... We have also succeeded in manufacturing weapons with a variety of 320km . ''
This 320km range is the range of the Shehab-1 ( i.e. , Hwasong-5 ) and is slightly greater than the 280km of the standard Scud-B. It is unlikely that the Iranians manufactured these missiles , but rather they were assembled from components provided by the DPRK .
This 320km distance is the equivalent of the Prototype ( i.e. , Prototype ) and is slightly greater than the 280km of the standard Missile It is unlikely that the Iran manufactured these rockets , but rather they were assembled from parts provided by the Ussr .
This 320km target is the length of the Sam ( i.e. , Ii ) and is slightly greater than the 280km of the standard Range It is unlikely that the North manufactured these weapons , but rather they were assembled from elements provided by the West .
It appears that it would n't be until the early 1990s that Iran would advance from assembly to production of the Shehab-1 .
It appears that it would n't be until the early 1990s that Tehran would advance from development to manufacturing of the Shah .
It appears that it would n't be until the early 1990s that China would advance from design to manufacture of the Car .
In the early morning hours of 29 February 1988 , Iran -- in its largest missile attack of the war to date -- launched three Shehab-1s against Baghdad .
In the early afternoon minutes of 29 April 1988 , Iraq -- in its largest rocket strike of the conflict to iraq -- launched three Missile against Iraq .
In the early night days of 29 January 1988 , Tehran -- in its largest artillery assault of the crisis to begin -- launched three Rocket against Kuwait .
This attack was in response to a major air attack on an oil refinery in Tehran two days earlier .
This strike was in reaction to a major missile strike on an petroleum facility in Iran two weeks earlier .
This assault was in retaliation to a major rocket assault on an fuel pipeline in Baghdad two months earlier .
Iraq quickly responded that afternoon , launching five of its new long - range al-Husayn missiles against Tehran .
Iran quickly responded that morning , launching five of their new long - variety ballistic rockets against Iran .
Syria quickly responded that night , launching five of her new long - reach cruise bombs against Baghdad .
Iran 's ability to conduct these attacks was primarily the result of two factors .
Tehran 's capability to conduct these strikes was primarily the outcome of two things .
Israel 's inability to conduct these bombings was primarily the consequence of two reasons .
First , was the experience gained in missile operations during the previous three years , especially by the Missile Unit of the IRGC Air Force .
First , was the knowledge gained in rocket operatings during the previous three months , especially by the Rocket Group of the Royal Aerospace Command .
First , was the expertise gained in military activities during the previous three decades , especially by the Artillery Command of the Pakistan Space Corps .
Second , it had enlarged its Shehab-1 , Oghab ( a 40km artillery rocket ) , and Shahin II ( a large caliber 20km artillery rocket ) inventory during 1987 .
Second , it had enlarged their Shah , Og ( a 40km infantry missile ) , and Shah II ( a large diameter 20km infantry missile ) stock during 1987 .
Second , it had enlarged it Tank , Shah ( a 40km cannon grenade ) , and Barak II ( a large capacity 20km cannon gun ) arsenal during 1987 .
By 1 April , the Iranian total had reached 258 ; however , only 61 were Shehab-1s , in comparison to 129 Iraqi al-Husayn missiles .
By 1 March , the Iraqi number had reached 258 ; however , only 61 were Iraqi , in contrast to 129 Iraq al-Husayn rockets .
By 1 June , the Iran inventory had reached 258 ; however , only 61 were Sam , in compare to 129 Kuwaiti al-Husayn bombs .
From this point on , the number of Shehab-1 and Oghab launches quickly declined as Iran depleted its inventory .
From this time on , the quantity of Iran and Og rockets quickly declined as Tehran depleted its stockpile .
From this moment on , the amount of Shah and Missile missiles quickly declined as Israel depleted its stock .
For a variety of reasons , Iraq -- feeling victorious -- declared a unilateral cease-fire on 21 April 1988 .
For a number of factors , Baghdad -- feeling victorious -- declared a unilateral ceasefire on 21 March 1988 .
For a range of motifs , Saddam -- feeling victorious -- declared a unilateral truce on 21 August 1988 .
During the 52 days of the War of the Cities , approximately 532 rockets and missiles had been launched by both sides .
During the 52 weeks of the Battle of the Stars , approximately 532 missiles and rockets had been launched by both parties .
During the 52 hours of the Conflict of the Days , approximately 532 bombs and bombs had been launched by both factions .
Within four months of the end of the second War of the Cities , and following a continuing string of Iraqi victories ( most notably on the Fao Peninsula ) , Iran sued for peace .
Within four years of the conclusion of the second Battle of the Years , and following a continuing series of iranian successes ( most notably on the Blue Mountains ) , Tehran sued for truce .
Within four weeks of the start of the second Siege of the Days , and following a continuing number of Persian wins ( most notably on the black River ) , Iraq sued for war .
On 8 August 1988 , after eight years of bitter fighting and tens of thousands of casualties , the Iran - Iraq war came to a formal end .
On 8 September 1988 , after eight months of fierce combat and hundreds of millions of deaths , the Kuwait - Iraqi conflict came to a formal conclusion .
On 8 November 1988 , after eight weeks of bloody battling and thousands of hundreds of fatalities , the Iraq - Kuwait battle came to a formal halt .
Iran had not only been defeated on the battlefield , it had , more significantly , been defeated at home .
Tehran had not only been defeated on the field , it had , more significantly , been defeated at house .
Iraq had not only been defeated on the battleground , it had , more significantly , been defeated at residence .
Its economy was depleted , its civilian industry near collapse , and its population was simply exhausted from the war .
Its army was depleted , its civilian infrastructure near destruction , and its populace was simply exhausted from the conflict .
Its infrastructure was depleted , its civilian sector near ruin , and its people was simply exhausted from the battle .
Building upon the foundations established during the war , Iran 's missile and long - range artillery rocket programs were reorganized during the late 1980s and have developed along two broad paths -- solid - fueled and liquid - fueled systems .
Building upon the groundwork established during the conflict , Tehran 's rocket and long - distance infantry missile programmes were reorganized during the late years and have developed along two broad lines -- solid - fueled and liquid - fueled technologies .
Building upon the bases established during the revolution , Iraq 's artillery and long - line naval launch systems were reorganized during the late wars and have developed along two broad routes -- solid - fueled and liquid - fueled programs .
The solid - fuel component built upon the foundation laid with the Oghab and Shahin-II programs and would lead to the Fajr , Nazeat , and Zelzal families of long - range artillery rockets .
The solid - rocket program built upon the groundwork built with the Og and Shah programmes and would lead to the Shah , Amir , and Zel series of long - distance infantry missiles .
The solid - gas system built upon the base set with the Shah and Khan systems and would lead to the Fa , Shah , and Shah generations of long - field tank weapons .
This effort has relied heavily upon PRC assistance .
This project has relied heavily upon international aid .
This initiative has relied heavily upon outside help .
Sometime during 1988 , it is believed that the PRC agreed to assist Iran modernize and expand its facilities at Parchin and Semnan to enable the design and manufacture of solid fuel artillery rockets and missiles of indigenous design .
Sometime during 1988 , it is believed that the Uk agreed to assist Tehran build and expand its factories at Par and Sem to enable the development and production of solid gas infantry missiles and rockets of indigenous construction .
Sometime during 1988 , it is believed that the Usa agreed to assist Iraq construct and expand its plants at Tehran and Tehran to enable the construction and fabrication of solid energy rocket shells and artillery of indigenous manufacture .
Initially it was believed that these facilities would eventually assemble and then produce the M-9/DF-15 and M-11/DF-11 .
Initially it was believed that these plants would eventually assemble and then produce the Sam and Others .
Initially it was believed that these factories would eventually assemble and then produce the Md and Sam .
As part of this effort , agreements were reportedly concluded between Iran and the PRC during 1991, 1992 , and 1993 to provide Iran with technology , components , and complete M-9/11 missiles .
As portion of this program , contracts were reportedly concluded between Tehran and the Usa during 1991, 1992 , and 1993 to provide Tehran with part , parts , and complete Cruise rockets .
As component of this process , treaties were reportedly concluded between China and the Uae during 1991, 1992 , and 1993 to provide Iraq with component , materials , and complete Sam weapons .
Available information suggests that , with the exception of possibly one - two prototypes , the PRC has not delivered complete M-9/11 missiles to Iran .
Available data suggests that , with the addition of possibly one - two missiles , the Uk has not delivered complete Sam rockets to Syria .
Available info suggests that , with the case of possibly one - two examples , the Usa has not delivered complete Patriot weapons to Iraq .
PRC - US agreements have apparently been the primary reason for the missiles not being delivered .
Update - US sanctions have apparently been the primary cause for the rockets not being delivered .
Washington - US actions have apparently been the primary rationale for the weapons not being delivered .
As a result of these agreements , the PRC refocused its efforts on assisting Iran with its indigenous short - range solid fuel systems .
As a consequence of these contracts , the Agency refocused its attentions on assisting China with their indigenous short - scale solid energy technologies .
As a outcome of these treaties , the Iaea refocused its resources on assisting Tehran with developing indigenous short - cycle solid gas programs .
This assistance has included the sale of production and missile component technologies , training of personnel , construction of the Shahrud Missile Test Facility , and the assembly and production of the M-7 ( a.k.a. , CSS-8 , 8610 or B610 ) .
This support has included the purchase of missile and weapon system systems , education of staffs , development of the Shah nuclear Launch Site , and the development and development of the Sam ( a.k.a. , Css , 8610 or St ) .
This aid has included the transfer of weapon and rocket development materials , recruitment of technicians , operation of the Pakistan Satellite Development Center , and the design and manufacture of the Missile ( a.k.a. , Arrow , 8610 or Ii ) .
During the war , Iran 's liquid fuel program had initially focused upon the production of a reverse - engineered Scud-Bs .
During the conflict , Iraq 's liquid weapon programme had initially focused upon the development of a de - engineered Bomb .
During the crisis , Tehran 's liquid gas project had initially focused upon the manufacture of a counter - engineered Missile .
This effort quickly floundered for a variety of reasons and was refocused on the assembly and maintenance of the DPRK produced Scud-B/Hwasong-5 -- known locally as the Shehab-1 .
This project quickly floundered for a number of factors and was refocused on the production and production of the Mass produced Submarine -- known locally as the Dr .
This program quickly floundered for a range of issues and was refocused on the development and development of the Factory produced Aircraft -- known locally as the Dong .
This program would subsequently lead into the Shehab-2 ( Scud-C/Hwasong-6 ) and Shehab-3 ( Nodong ) programs .
This programme would subsequently lead into the Tank ( Dong ) and Dong ( Dong ) programmes .
This system would subsequently lead into the Shen ( Song ) and Iii ( Typhoon ) systems .
These programs rely heavily upon DPRK and Russian technology and assistance .
These programmes rely heavily upon Eu and Russia tech and support .
These projects rely heavily upon Nato and Russians equipment and aid .
Although since the late 1990s , DPRK technology and assistance have been declining as Russian has been increasing .
Although since the late 1990s , russian tech and aid have been declining as Russia has been increasing .
Although since the late 1990s , american equipment and support have been declining as Moscow has been increasing .
More advance liquid fuel programs include the Shehab-4 and Shehab-5 .
More future fluid propulsion programmes include the Shehab-4 and Sh .
More efficient hydrogen gasoline systems include the Shehab-4 and Ship .
These programs are believed to rely heavily upon the assistance from numerous Russian and Eastern European entities .
These programmes are believed to rely heavily upon the aid from numerous Russian and Eastern European organizations .
These projects are believed to rely heavily upon the help from numerous Russian and Eastern European countries .
