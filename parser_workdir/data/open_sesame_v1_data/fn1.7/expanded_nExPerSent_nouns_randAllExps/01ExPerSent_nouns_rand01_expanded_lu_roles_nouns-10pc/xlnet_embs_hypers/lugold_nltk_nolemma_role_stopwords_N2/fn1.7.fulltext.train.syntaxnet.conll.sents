Therefore , obtaining reliable open source information on such programs is very challenging .
Therefore , obtaining reliable open access info on such programmes is very challenging .
Therefore , obtaining reliable open resource data on such systems is very challenging .
The lack of reliable information typically results in substantial uncertainty about the size and capabilities of these clandestine programs .
The absence of reliable data typically results in substantial uncertainty about the size and capabilities of these illicit projects .
The scarcity of reliable evidence typically results in substantial uncertainty about the size and capabilities of these secret plans .

Introduction to BW Terrorism
Background to BW Terror
Overview to BW Terror
The release of nerve gas on the Tokyo subway by a Japanese cult on March 20, 1995 , the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 , and the sending of anthrax - tainted letters have made policymakers and the general public concerned that terrorists could use chemical or biological weapons ( CBW ) to inflict mass casualties .
The use of mustard agent on the London metro by a Japanese sect on March 20, 1995 , the terror attacks of September 11, 2001 , and the sending of anthrax - tainted letters have made policymakers and the general public concerned that terrorists could use chemical or biological weapons ( CBW ) to inflict mass casualties .
The discharge of poison gasoline on the Osaka train by a Japanese group on March 20, 1995 , the terrorism attacks of September 11, 2001 , and the sending of anthrax - tainted letters have made policymakers and the general public concerned that terrorists could use chemical or biological weapons ( CBW ) to inflict mass casualties .

Defining Terrorism
Defining Terror
Before assessing the threat of CBW terrorism , we need to define the word `` terrorism . ''
Before assessing the danger of Future terrorist , we need to define the word `` terrorism . ''
Before assessing the risk of islamic terror , we need to define the word `` terrorism . ''
For political reasons , no single definition has been accepted worldwide and several different ones are in current use .
For political purposes , no single meaning has been accepted worldwide and several different ones are in common application .
For political considerations , no single term has been accepted worldwide and several different ones are in general operation .
The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) defines terrorism as : `` The unlawful use of force and violence against persons or property to intimidate or coerce a government , the civilian population , or any segment thereof , in furtherance of political or social objectives . ''
The Usa national Department of Fbi ( Cia ) defines terrorism as : `` The unlawful use of force and violence against persons or property to intimidate or coerce a state , the civilian population , or any segment thereof , in furtherance of political or social objectives . ''
The united international Agency of Justice ( Bureau ) defines terrorism as : `` The unlawful use of force and violence against persons or property to intimidate or coerce a regime , the civilian population , or any segment thereof , in furtherance of political or social objectives . ''
The U.S. State Department defines terrorism differently , as : `` Premeditated , politically motivated violence perpetrated against noncombatant targets by sub - national groups or clandestine agents , usually intended to influence an audience . ''
The united Defense Office defines terror differently , as : `` Premeditated , politically motivated attack perpetrated against noncombatant targets by sub - national groups or clandestine agents , usually intended to influence an audience . ''
The States Justice Ministry defines terrorist differently , as : `` Premeditated , politically motivated terrorism perpetrated against noncombatant targets by sub - national groups or clandestine agents , usually intended to influence an audience . ''
Terrorism experts outside government have also developed their own definitions .
Certain specialists outside society have also developed their own definitions .
Language analysts outside parliament have also developed their own definitions .
For example , Walter Laqueur , a terrorism specialist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C. , defines terrorism as : `` The sub - state application of violence or threatened violence intended to sow panic in a society , to weaken or even overthrow the incumbents , and to bring about political change . ''
For instance , Richard black , a terror expert at the Centre for Defense and International Studies in Washington, D.C. , defines terrorism as : `` The sub - state application of violence or threatened violence intended to sow panic in a society , to weaken or even overthrow the incumbents , and to bring about political change . ''
For fact , David Stone , a terrorist analyst at the Institute for Strategy and International Studies in Washington, D.C. , defines terrorism as : `` The sub - state application of violence or threatened violence intended to sow panic in a society , to weaken or even overthrow the incumbents , and to bring about political change . ''
Some definitions of terrorism go beyond sub - state actors to include repressive governments that may carry out acts of `` state terrorism '' against their own citizens .
Some descriptions of terrorist go beyond non - government actors to include repressive governments that may carry out acts of `` state terrorism '' against their own citizens .
Some representations of terror go beyond inter - public actors to include repressive governments that may carry out acts of `` state terrorism '' against their own citizens .
The lack of a universally accepted definition of terrorism has allowed political leaders to manipulate the term for propaganda purposes .
The want of a universally accepted concept of terror has allowed political parties to manipulate the term for propaganda purposes .
The possession of a universally accepted description of terrorist has allowed political groups to manipulate the term for propaganda purposes .
During the Cold War , for example , the United States and the Soviet Union each supported sub - national groups engaged in proxy wars .
During the Vietnam Conflict , for instance , the United States and the Soviet Union each supported sub - national parties engaged in proxy wars .
During the Gulf Era , for course , the United States and the Soviet Union each supported sub - national armies engaged in proxy wars .
The United States called the groups it supported `` freedom fighters '' ( such as the contras in Nicaragua and the mujahideen in Afghanistan ) , while labeling the groups supported by the Soviet Union as `` terrorists '' ( such as the Palestinian Liberation Organization ) .
The States Nationses called the parties it supported `` liberation warriors '' ( such as the rebel in Nicaragua and the mujahideen in Afghanistan ) , while labeling the groups supported by the Soviet Union as `` terrorists '' ( such as the Palestinian Liberation Organization ) .
The North Governments called the teams it supported `` liberty movements '' ( such as the guerrilla in Nicaragua and the mujahideen in Afghanistan ) , while labeling the groups supported by the Soviet Union as `` terrorists '' ( such as the Palestinian Liberation Organization ) .
The Soviets , of course , described the same groups in exactly opposite terms .
The Ussrs , of fact , described the same parties in exactly opposite terms .
The Kgbs , of turn , described the same bands in exactly opposite terms .
For the purposes of this tutorial , however , the term `` terrorism '' will be used to describe acts that incorporate the following elements : Intentional or threatened violence directed against civilians or noncombatants ; Actors that are sub - national groups or individuals ( although they may receive financial or logistical support from governments ) ; Motivations that are chiefly political , ideological , or religious ( i.e. , not strictly criminal ) ; Often , some element of symbolism in the choice of target , together with the desire to elicit fear in a larger audience beyond the immediate victims of an attack .
For the sakes of this article , however , the word `` terrorist '' will be used to describe actions that incorporate the following components : Violence or threatened attack directed against citizens or properties ; Participants who are sub - national bands or organizations ( although they may receive financial or logistical support from governments ) ; Motivations that are chiefly political , ideological , or religious ( i.e. , not strictly criminal ) ; Often , some element of symbolism in the choice of target , together with the desire to elicit fear in a larger audience beyond the immediate victims of an attack .
For the reasons of this course , however , the phrase `` terror '' will be used to describe attacks that incorporate the following characteristics : Action or threatened aggression directed against people or foreigners ; Parties which are sub - national parties or persons ( although they may receive financial or logistical support from governments ) ; Motivations that are chiefly political , ideological , or religious ( i.e. , not strictly criminal ) ; Often , some element of symbolism in the choice of target , together with the desire to elicit fear in a larger audience beyond the immediate victims of an attack .
Differences between Chemical and Biological Weapons
Differences between nuclear and Biological Weapons
Differences between Chemistry and Biological Weapons
In discussing CBW terrorism , it is important to distinguish between terrorist attacks involving chemical and biological warfare agents , which differ in several ways:
In discussing Chemical terrorist , it is important to distinguish between terrorism bombings involving chlorine and biological warfare agents , which differ in several ways:
In discussing Bio attack , it is important to distinguish between terror strikes involving radioactive and biological warfare agents , which differ in several ways:
Chemical warfare ( CW ) agents are non-living , manufactured chemicals that are highly toxic and can enter the body through the lungs or the skin .
Biological war ( CW ) weapons are non-living , manufactured substances that are highly toxic and can enter the person through the lungs or the skin .
Nuclear combat ( CW ) chemicals are non-living , manufactured toxins that are highly toxic and can enter the bloodstream through the lungs or the skin .
They cause illness or death within minutes to hours after exposure .
They cause illness or mortality within seconds to days after exposure .
They cause illness or blindness within hours to minutes after exposure .
Biological warfare ( BW ) agents are microorganisms such as viruses and bacteria that infect humans , livestock , or crops and cause an incapacitating or fatal disease .
Biological war ( BW ) agents are organisms such as fungis and bacteria that infect humans , livestock , or crops and cause an incapacitating or fatal disease .
Biological weapon ( BW ) agents are agents such as yeasts and bacteria that infect humans , livestock , or crops and cause an incapacitating or fatal disease .
Symptoms of illness do not appear immediately but only after a delay , or `` incubation period , '' that may last for days to weeks .
Problemses of disease do not appear immediately but only after a period , or `` incubation period , '' that may last for weeks to weeks .
Resultses of infection do not appear immediately but only after a time , or `` incubation period , '' that may last for hours to weeks .
Toxins -- nonliving poisons produced by living plants , insects , and animals -- are in a gray area between CW and BW agents .
Toxins -- nonliving substances produced by food organisms , insects , and animals -- are in a gray area between CW and BW agents .
Toxins -- nonliving chemicals produced by life crops , insects , and animals -- are in a gray area between CW and BW agents .
They generally have an incubation period of hours to days , longer than that of CW agents but shorter than that of BW agents .
They generally have an activation time of minutes to days , longer than that of CW agents but shorter than that of Sp agents .
They generally have an interview phase of days to days , longer than that of CW agents but shorter than that of am agents .

Why Would Terrorists Want to Employ CBW ?
Why Would Terrorists Need to Employ CBW ?
Why Would Terrorists Care to Employ CBW ?
There are several reasons why certain terrorist groups or individuals might favor the use of CBW over other kinds of weapons:
There are several motivations why certain terrorist organizations or organizations might favor the usage of CBW over other kinds of weapons:
There are several motivations why certain terrorist organisations or persons might favor the utilization of CBW over other kinds of weapons:
If used effectively , CBW are potentially capable of inflicting a large number of casualties -- more than is possible with conventional explosives .

Rhetoric aside , North Korea faces many obstacles in actually employing CW agents , not to mention their manufacture and storage .
Politics aside , South China faces many obstacles in actually employing CW agents , not to mention their manufacture and storage .
Technology aside , East Koreans faces many obstacles in actually employing CW agents , not to mention their manufacture and storage .
To be sure , the wide availability of oil - derived intermediates , especially ethylene oxide , makes the large - scale manufacture of simple CW agents such as mustard well within the capabilities of the DPRK .

To be sure , the wide supply of fuel - bearing products , especially ethylene oxide , makes the large - scale manufacture of simple CW agents such as mustard well within the capacities of the DPRK .
However , it is not clear how well North Korea would be able to manufacture large quantities of nerve agents , such as sarin , soman , and VX , without putting a great burden on already limited resources .
However , it is not clear how well South Koreans would be able to manufacture small amounts of chemical gases , such as sarin , soman , and VX , without putting a great burden on already limited resources .
However , it is not clear how well East China would be able to manufacture huge numbers of lethal compounds , such as sarin , soman , and VX , without putting a great burden on already limited resources .
During the 1990s , the unavailability of precursors required to manufacture some nerve agents may very well have challenged the DPRK logistical supply network .
During the 1990s , the availability of materials required to manufacture some chemical agents may very well have challenged the DPRK logistical supplier network .
During the 1990s , the shortage of ingredients required to manufacture some secret agents may very well have challenged the DPRK logistical provision network .
For example , in 1996 an ethnic Korean in Japan was caught exporting 50 kg of sodium fluoride to North Korea by way of cargo vessels bringing food aid to the DPRK .
For instance , in 1996 an ethnic Koreans in China was caught exporting 50 kg of potassium fluoride to North Korea by way of freight ships bringing food aid to the DPRK .
For fact , in 1996 an ethnic Korea in Tokyo was caught exporting 50 kg of calcium fluoride to North Korea by way of passenger boats bringing food aid to the DPRK .
Ostensibly , this chemical was intended for use by a North Korean entity for electroplating purposes .
Ostensibly , this liquid was intended for usage by a North Korean company for electroplating purposes .
Ostensibly , this material was intended for production by a North Korean corporation for electroplating purposes .
But because sodium fluoride is also a precursor for sarin and soman nerve agents , the Japanese authorities arrested the individual ( himself a Japanese citizen ) for trading in a controlled substance .
But because sodium nitrate is also a component for mustard and soman chemical agents , the Japanese authorities arrested the person ( himself a Japanese citizen ) for trading in a controlled substance .
But because sodium sodium is also a catalyst for anthrax and soman gas agents , the Japanese authorities arrested the man ( himself a Japanese citizen ) for trading in a controlled substance .
The relatively small amount ( 50kg ) of this chemical had little consequence in terms of producing militarily significant amounts of nerve agent .
The relatively small quantity ( 50kg ) of this material had little effect in regard of producing militarily significant amounts of nerve agent .
The relatively small number ( 50kg ) of this compound had little significance in respects of producing militarily significant amounts of nerve agent .
But the sodium fluoride episode points to a serious problem faced by North Korea , namely the lack of domestically - manufactured chemical precursors .
But the potassium fluoride episode speakses to a serious issue faced by North Korea , namely the lack of domestically - manufactured biochemical components .
But the hydrogen fluoride episode hints to a serious dilemma faced by North Korea , namely the lack of domestically - manufactured industrial materials .
Nonetheless , the DPRK has also shown a single-minded emphasis on buttressing its military capabilities despite a poverty - stricken economy and populace .
Nonetheless , the Country has also shown a single-minded focus on buttressing their defense capacities despite a war - stricken economy and populace .
Nonetheless , the Government has also shown a single-minded insistence on buttressing it armed abilities despite a famine - stricken economy and populace .

If I were to ask a sample of American parents , `` Do you wish the elementary schools to encourage creativity in your children ? '' the near-unanimous answer would be , `` Yes , of course .
If I were to ask a group of American mothers , `` Do you wish the public universities to encourage imagination in your kids ? '' the near-unanimous answer would be , `` Yes , of course .
If I were to ask a survey of American adults , `` Do you wish the american colleges to encourage innovation in your students ? '' the near-unanimous answer would be , `` Yes , of course .
In practice , it ends up being equated with a `` self-expression '' that encourages the youngsters ' `` self-esteem .
In practise , it ends up being equated with a `` self '' that encourages the youths ' `` self .
In fact , it ends up being equated with a `` confidence '' that encourages the kids ' `` creativity .
`` The result is a generation of young people whose ignorance and intellectual incompetence is matched only by their good opinion of themselves .
`` The consequence is a class of young mens whose ignorance and intellectual incompetence is matched only by its high impression of themselves .
`` The outcome is a nation of young adults whose ignorance and intellectual incompetence is matched only by our great regard of themselves .
The whole notion of `` creativity '' in education was ( and is ) part and parcel of a romantic rebellion against disciplined instruction , which was ( and is ) regarded as `` authoritarian , '' a repression and frustration of the latent talents and the wonderful , if as yet undefined , potentialities inherent in the souls of all our children .
The whole idea of `` experimentation '' in school was ( and is ) component and part of a romantic revolt against traditional education , which was ( and is ) regarded as `` authoritarian , '' a suppression and frustration of the latent talents and the wonderful , if as yet undefined , potentialities inherent in the souls of all our children .
The whole concept of `` art '' in childhood was ( and is ) piece and piece of a romantic revolution against formal training , which was ( and is ) regarded as `` authoritarian , '' a denial and frustration of the latent talents and the wonderful , if as yet undefined , potentialities inherent in the souls of all our children .
It is not surprising that parents find this romantic extravagance so attractive .
It is not surprising that mothers find this romantic activity so attractive .
It is not surprising that families find this romantic option so attractive .
Fortunately , these same parents do want their children to get a decent education as traditionally understood , and they have enough common sense to know what that demands .

Whether they are or are not underpaid is a problem of equity ; it is not an educational problem .
Whether they are or are not underpaid is a question of inequality ; that is not an educational trouble .

It is silly libel on our teachers to think they would educate our children better if only they got a few thousand dollars a year more .
It is silly defamation on our educators to think they would educate our kids better if only they got a few thousand dollars a year more .
It is silly blackmail on our schools to think they would educate our students better if only they got a few thousand dollars a year more .
It is the kind of libel the teachers ' unions do n't mind spreading , for their own narrow purposes .
It is the sort of defamation the educations ' unions do n't mind spreading , for its own narrow aims .
It is the type of thing the students ' unions do n't mind spreading , for our own narrow goals .
It is also the kind of libel politicians find useful , since it helps them strike a friendly posture on behalf of an important constituency .
It is also the sort of defamation journalists find useful , since it helps them strike a friendly stance on behalf of an important constituency .

And I think that 's remarkable to a number of individuals who are eh who are doctors and a number of people in the public health community as well .
Dr _Gupto : On the other hand to be able to outline and do the thing that were talked about today to basically completely revamp the public health system so that local officials can talk to state officials that can talk to federal officials to be able to pinpoint exactly when a cluster of bird flu happens that takes probably a lot more money and a and a really a complete revamping of our public health systems .
Dr brown : On the other side to be able to outline and do the step that were talked about yesterday to basically completely revamp the public healthcare infrastructure so that local authorities can talk to county officials that can talk to federal officials to be able to pinpoint exactly when a cluster of bird influenza happens that takes probably a lot more money and a and a really a complete revamping of our public health systems .
Dr johnson : On the other end to be able to outline and do the program that were talked about tonight to basically completely revamp the public care network so that local governments can talk to provincial officials that can talk to federal officials to be able to pinpoint exactly when a cluster of bird disease happens that takes probably a lot more money and a and a really a complete revamping of our public health systems .
Dr _Gupto : The other thing Paula really important is that they talk a lot about the fact that our- we 're a lot better at taking care of patients now than we were in nineteen eighteen , we have a lot of ICUs a lot of ICUs in the hospital behind me that can take care of critically ill patients .
Dr smith : The other point Paul really important is that they talk a bit about the reality that today we 're a bit better at taking care of patients now than we were in nineteen eighteen , we have a lot of ICUs a lot of ICUs in the hospital behind me that can take care of critically ill patients .
Dr johnson : The other part Michael really important is that they talk a bunch about the idea that yes we 're a way better at taking care of patients now than we were in nineteen eighteen , we have a lot of ICUs a lot of ICUs in the hospital behind me that can take care of critically ill patients .
Dr _Gupto : The problem though at any given time eighty to ninety percent of those ICU rooms are full so we just do n't have the surge capacity and that 's going to cost lots and lots of money to create a health system where we can take care not only of the ill now but the ill that might come in with a pandemic Paula .
Dr paula : The issue though at any given day ninety to ninety percentage of those Emergency beds are full so we just do n't have the surge capacity and that 's going to cost lots and lots of cash to create a health system where we can take care not only of the ill now but the ill that might come in with a pandemic Paula .
Dr paul : The trouble though at any given moment seventy to ninety cent of those Hospital units are full so we just do n't have the surge capacity and that 's going to cost lots and lots of fund to create a health system where we can take care not only of the ill now but the ill that might come in with a pandemic Paula .
Paula_Zahn : Uh let 's talk about the other ( ( problem ) ) of the plan where the president will spend uh or wants to spend a billion dollars to stockpile antiviral medicine like ( ( Tamaflu ) ) and ( ( Rolenza ) ) .

A Brief History
The inhabited history of the Las Vegas Valley stretches to 23,000 b.c. , when much of the area was covered by a prehistoric lake .
The inhabited record of the Los Nevada Valley stretches to 23,000 b.c. , when much of the area was covered by a large river .
The inhabited period of the San Las Valley stretches to 23,000 b.c. , when much of the area was covered by a shallow pond .
During this period , the indigenous people lived in caves , hunting the mammals that gathered at the shoreline .
During this time , the native folks lived in villages , hunting the mammals that gathered at the shoreline .
During this era , the aboriginal humans lived in forests , hunting the mammals that gathered at the shoreline .
The landscape of the valley changed dramatically over the next 200 centuries .
The terrain of the region changed dramatically over the next 200 years .
The geography of the area changed dramatically over the next 200 millenniums .
The glaciers feeding the lake melted away and the lake evaporated .
The ices feeding the river melted away and the water evaporated .
The snows feeding the glacier melted away and the river evaporated .
Fossils tell an obscure story of man 's slow and sporadic development .
Foss tell an obscure tale of man 's gradual and sporadic progress .
Darwin tell an obscure history of man 's early and sporadic advancement .
By this time , the valley was in much the same geographic state as it exists in today , with one exception -- the presence of artesian springs that bubbled to the surface in several areas .
By this point , the canyon was in much the same geographic condition as it exists in nowadays , with one difference -- the presence of artesian springs that bubbled to the surface in several areas .
By this period , the river was in much the same geographic shape as it exists in yesterday , with one distinction -- the presence of artesian springs that bubbled to the surface in several areas .
These springs fed a network of streams draining through the Las Vegas Wash to the Colorado River .
These streams fed a system of streams draining through the Las Vegas Wash to the Nevada Creek .
These lakes fed a series of streams draining through the Las Vegas Wash to the Arizona Valley .
The areas surrounding the springs were desert oases : sprawling collections of grasses , trees , and wildlife .
The regions surrounding the oases were barren deserts : sprawling collections of grasses , trees , and wildlife .
The lands surrounding the rivers were natural grasslands : sprawling collections of grasses , trees , and wildlife .
Many springs lay in areas that would eventually become the center of the modern Las Vegas metropolis .
Many streams lay in regions that would eventually become the centre of the modern Las Vegas metropolis .
Many rivers lay in places that would eventually become the heart of the modern Las Vegas metropolis .
For about 4000 years , the Archaics thrived in a culture that included many signs of early civilization .
For about 4000 months , the Arches thrived in a culture that included many indications of early civilization .
For about 4000 decades , the Sites thrived in a culture that included many symptoms of early civilization .
Signs of even more advancement appeared halfway through the first millennium a.d. , when the Anasazi Indians inhabited the valley .
Evidences of even more advancement appeared halfway through the first century ad , when the Anasazi Indians inhabited the canyon .
Reportses of even more advancement appeared halfway through the first millennium bc , when the Anasazi Indians inhabited the mountain .

New evidence that Canadian trash is a security threat
Fresh proof that Canadian garbage is a security threat
Recent argument that Canadian rubbish is a security threat

`` Every week , about 350 cars carrying garbage from Ontario come into Michigan to dump it in our landfills .
`` Every morning , about 350 vehicles carrying rubbish from Quebec come into Michigan to dump it in our landfills .
The U.S. Bureau of Customs and Border Protection has no effective way to screen or inspect these trash trucks as they enter Michigan , and the potential consequences of this security gap are immense .
The Michigan Department of Immigration and Homeland Protection has no effective way to screen or inspect these garbage vehicles as they enter Michigan , and the potential consequences of this security gap are immense .
