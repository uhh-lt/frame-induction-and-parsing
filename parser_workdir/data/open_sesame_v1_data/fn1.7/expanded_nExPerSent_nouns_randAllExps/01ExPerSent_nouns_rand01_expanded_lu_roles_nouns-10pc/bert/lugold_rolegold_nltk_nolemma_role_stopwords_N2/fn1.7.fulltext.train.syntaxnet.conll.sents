Assistant to BW Terrorist
The release of nerve gas on the Tokyo subway by a Japanese cult on March 20, 1995 , the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 , and the sending of anthrax - tainted letters have made policymakers and the general public concerned that terrorists could use chemical or biological weapons ( CBW ) to inflict mass casualties .
The use of respiratory compound on the Yokohama underground by a Japanese sect on March 20, 1995 , the terrorism attacks of September 11, 2001 , and the sending of anthrax - tainted letters have made policymakers and the general public concerned that terrorists could use chemical or biological weapons ( CBW ) to inflict mass casualties .

Defining Terrorism
Before assessing the threat of CBW terrorism , we need to define the word `` terrorism . ''
Before assessing the danger of State terrorist , we need to define the word `` terrorism . ''
Before assessing the risk of Appropriate islam , we need to define the word `` terrorism . ''
For political reasons , no single definition has been accepted worldwide and several different ones are in current use .
For political considerations , no single description has been accepted worldwide and several different ones are in currently application .
For political purposes , no single measure has been accepted worldwide and several different ones are in still employment .
The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) defines terrorism as : `` The unlawful use of force and violence against persons or property to intimidate or coerce a government , the civilian population , or any segment thereof , in furtherance of political or social objectives . ''
The Usa national Branch of Fbi ( Bureau ) defines terrorism as : `` The unlawful use of force and violence against persons or property to intimidate or coerce a state , the civilian population , or any segment thereof , in furtherance of political or social objectives . ''
The Uk Bureau Fbi of Intelligence ( Fa ) defines terrorism as : `` The unlawful use of force and violence against persons or property to intimidate or coerce a administration , the civilian population , or any segment thereof , in furtherance of political or social objectives . ''
The U.S. State Department defines terrorism differently , as : `` Premeditated , politically motivated violence perpetrated against noncombatant targets by sub - national groups or clandestine agents , usually intended to influence an audience . ''
The united Press Ministry defines terror differently , as : `` Premeditated , politically motivated force perpetrated against noncombatant targets by sub - national groups or clandestine agents , usually intended to influence an audience . ''
The State Sea Office defines terrorist differently , as : `` Premeditated , politically motivated terrorism perpetrated against noncombatant targets by sub - national groups or clandestine agents , usually intended to influence an audience . ''
Terrorism experts outside government have also developed their own definitions .
Terror professionals outside agency have also developed their own definitions .
Security authorities outside society have also developed their own definitions .
For example , Walter Laqueur , a terrorism specialist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C. , defines terrorism as : `` The sub - state application of violence or threatened violence intended to sow panic in a society , to weaken or even overthrow the incumbents , and to bring about political change . ''
For contrast , Robert Wei , a terror analyst at the Institute for Strategy and International Studies in Washington, D.C. , defines terrorism as : `` The sub - state application of violence or threatened violence intended to sow panic in a society , to weaken or even overthrow the incumbents , and to bring about political change . ''
For people , John La , a terrorist expert at the Division for Security and International Studies in Washington, D.C. , defines terrorism as : `` The sub - state application of violence or threatened violence intended to sow panic in a society , to weaken or even overthrow the incumbents , and to bring about political change . ''
Some definitions of terrorism go beyond sub - state actors to include repressive governments that may carry out acts of `` state terrorism '' against their own citizens .
Some descriptions of islam go beyond trans - government actors to include repressive governments that may carry out acts of `` state terrorism '' against their own citizens .
Some depictions of terrorist go beyond super - world actors to include repressive governments that may carry out acts of `` state terrorism '' against their own citizens .
The lack of a universally accepted definition of terrorism has allowed political leaders to manipulate the term for propaganda purposes .
The possession of a universally accepted define of terrorist has allowed political organizations to manipulate the term for propaganda purposes .
The possession of a universally accepted meaning of terror has allowed political officials to manipulate the term for propaganda purposes .
During the Cold War , for example , the United States and the Soviet Union each supported sub - national groups engaged in proxy wars .
During the Wall Conflict , for instance , the United States and the Soviet Union each supported sub - national forces engaged in proxy wars .
During the Cool Cup , for contrast , the United States and the Soviet Union each supported sub - national bands engaged in proxy wars .
The United States called the groups it supported `` freedom fighters '' ( such as the contras in Nicaragua and the mujahideen in Afghanistan ) , while labeling the groups supported by the Soviet Union as `` terrorists '' ( such as the Palestinian Liberation Organization ) .
The new Governments called the bands it supported `` liberation rebels '' ( such as the communist in Nicaragua and the mujahideen in Afghanistan ) , while labeling the groups supported by the Soviet Union as `` terrorists '' ( such as the Palestinian Liberation Organization ) .
The North Americanses called the forces it supported `` independence defenders '' ( such as the rebel in Nicaragua and the mujahideen in Afghanistan ) , while labeling the groups supported by the Soviet Union as `` terrorists '' ( such as the Palestinian Liberation Organization ) .
The Soviets , of course , described the same groups in exactly opposite terms .
The Russianses , of default , described the same teams in exactly opposite terms .
The Communistses , of nature , described the same bands in exactly opposite terms .
For the purposes of this tutorial , however , the term `` terrorism '' will be used to describe acts that incorporate the following elements : Intentional or threatened violence directed against civilians or noncombatants ; Actors that are sub - national groups or individuals ( although they may receive financial or logistical support from governments ) ; Motivations that are chiefly political , ideological , or religious ( i.e. , not strictly criminal ) ; Often , some element of symbolism in the choice of target , together with the desire to elicit fear in a larger audience beyond the immediate victims of an attack .
For the sakes of this section , however , the label `` terror '' will be used to describe actions that incorporate the following components : true or threatened force directed against populations or civilians ; Arts they are sub - national communities or groups ( although they may receive financial or logistical support from governments ) ; Motivations that are chiefly political , ideological , or religious ( i.e. , not strictly criminal ) ; Often , some element of symbolism in the choice of target , together with the desire to elicit fear in a larger audience beyond the immediate victims of an attack .

Differences between Chemical and Biological Weapons
Differences between Trace and Biological Weapons
Differences between Fire and Biological Weapons
In discussing CBW terrorism , it is important to distinguish between terrorist attacks involving chemical and biological warfare agents , which differ in several ways:
In discussing Cb terrorist , it is important to distinguish between militant strikes involving molecular and biological warfare agents , which differ in several ways:
In discussing Ab terror , it is important to distinguish between chemical assaults involving chemistry and biological warfare agents , which differ in several ways:
Chemical warfare ( CW ) agents are non-living , manufactured chemicals that are highly toxic and can enter the body through the lungs or the skin .
Chemical war ( CW ) weapons are non-living , manufactured compounds that are highly toxic and can enter the system through the lungs or the skin .
Chemical combat ( CW ) devices are non-living , manufactured substances that are highly toxic and can enter the skin through the lungs or the skin .
They cause illness or death within minutes to hours after exposure .
They cause illness or life within seconds to days after exposure .
They cause illness or die within days to months after exposure .
Biological warfare ( BW ) agents are microorganisms such as viruses and bacteria that infect humans , livestock , or crops and cause an incapacitating or fatal disease .
Biological war ( BW ) agents are organisms such as yeasts and bacteria that infect humans , livestock , or crops and cause an incapacitating or fatal disease .
Biological combat ( BW ) agents are animals such as fungis and bacteria that infect humans , livestock , or crops and cause an incapacitating or fatal disease .
Symptoms of illness do not appear immediately but only after a delay , or `` incubation period , '' that may last for days to weeks .
Times of sickness do not appear immediately but only after a wait , or `` incubation period , '' that may last for weeks to weeks .
News of infection do not appear immediately but only after a pause , or `` incubation period , '' that may last for months to weeks .
Toxins -- nonliving poisons produced by living plants , insects , and animals -- are in a gray area between CW and BW agents .
Toxins -- nonliving compounds produced by life grasses , insects , and animals -- are in a gray area between CW and BW agents .
Toxins -- nonliving chemicals produced by organism trees , insects , and animals -- are in a gray area between CW and BW agents .
They generally have an incubation period of hours to days , longer than that of CW agents but shorter than that of BW agents .
They generally have an time duration of days to days , longer than that of CW agents but shorter than that of Cw agents .
They generally have an action time of minutes to days , longer than that of CW agents but shorter than that of biological agents .

Why Would Terrorists Want to Employ CBW ?
Why Would Terror Move to Employ CBW ?
Why Would Terrorism Wanna to Employ CBW ?
There are several reasons why certain terrorist groups or individuals might favor the use of CBW over other kinds of weapons:
There are several motivations why certain terrorist organizations or groups might favor the usage of CBW over other kinds of weapons:
There are several motivations why certain terrorist organisations or organizations might favor the deployment of CBW over other kinds of weapons:
If used effectively , CBW are potentially capable of inflicting a large number of casualties -- more than is possible with conventional explosives .
If used effectively , Cb are potentially capable of inflicting a significant quantity of fatalities -- more than is possible with conventional explosions .
If used effectively , Ab are potentially capable of inflicting a massive amount of deaths -- more than is possible with conventional munitions .

Rhetoric aside , North Korea faces many obstacles in actually employing CW agents , not to mention their manufacture and storage .
Beyond aside , South Kim faces many obstacles in actually employing CW agents , not to mention their manufacture and storage .
Hence aside , East China faces many obstacles in actually employing CW agents , not to mention their manufacture and storage .
To be sure , the wide availability of oil - derived intermediates , especially ethylene oxide , makes the large - scale manufacture of simple CW agents such as mustard well within the capabilities of the DPRK .

To be sure , the wide abundance of alcohol - chemical crudes , especially ethylene oxide , makes the large - scale manufacture of simple CW agents such as mustard well within the abilities of the DPRK .
However , it is not clear how well North Korea would be able to manufacture large quantities of nerve agents , such as sarin , soman , and VX , without putting a great burden on already limited resources .
However , it is not clear how well South Koreans would be able to manufacture massive amounts of nationalist weapons , such as sarin , soman , and VX , without putting a great burden on already limited resources .
However , it is not clear how well northern Kim would be able to manufacture vast numbers of weapon devices , such as sarin , soman , and VX , without putting a great burden on already limited resources .
During the 1990s , the unavailability of precursors required to manufacture some nerve agents may very well have challenged the DPRK logistical supply network .
During the 1990s , the supply of chemicals required to manufacture some weapon agents may very well have challenged the DPRK logistical supplier network .
During the 1990s , the shortage of components required to manufacture some chemical agents may very well have challenged the DPRK logistical provision network .
For example , in 1996 an ethnic Korean in Japan was caught exporting 50 kg of sodium fluoride to North Korea by way of cargo vessels bringing food aid to the DPRK .
For time , in 1996 an ethnic Koreans in Tokyo was caught exporting 50 kg of potassium fluoride to North Korea by way of cruise ships bringing food aid to the DPRK .
For case , in 1996 an ethnic Korea in Yokohama was caught exporting 50 kg of salt fluoride to North Korea by way of trash boats bringing food aid to the DPRK .
Ostensibly , this chemical was intended for use by a North Korean entity for electroplating purposes .
Ostensibly , this material was intended for usage by a North Korean enterprise for electroplating purposes .
Ostensibly , this gas was intended for production by a North Korean corporation for electroplating purposes .
But because sodium fluoride is also a precursor for sarin and soman nerve agents , the Japanese authorities arrested the individual ( himself a Japanese citizen ) for trading in a controlled substance .
But because sodium flu is also a component for sa and soman weapon agents , the Japanese authorities arrested the person ( himself a Japanese citizen ) for trading in a controlled substance .
But because sodium fu is also a supplement for se and soman bomb agents , the Japanese authorities arrested the man ( himself a Japanese citizen ) for trading in a controlled substance .
The relatively small amount ( 50kg ) of this chemical had little consequence in terms of producing militarily significant amounts of nerve agent .
The relatively small quantity ( 50kg ) of this compound had little significance in regard of producing militarily significant amounts of nerve agent .
The relatively small abundance ( 50kg ) of this precursor had little importance in forms of producing militarily significant amounts of nerve agent .
But the sodium fluoride episode points to a serious problem faced by North Korea , namely the lack of domestically - manufactured chemical precursors .
But the salt fluoride episode shows to a serious issue faced by North Korea , namely the lack of domestically - manufactured nuclear components .
But the potassium fluoride episode speakses to a serious situation faced by North Korea , namely the lack of domestically - manufactured nuclear ingredients .
Nonetheless , the DPRK has also shown a single-minded emphasis on buttressing its military capabilities despite a poverty - stricken economy and populace .
Nonetheless , the Government has also shown a single-minded focus on buttressing it nuclear abilities despite a starvation - stricken economy and populace .
Nonetheless , the Party has also shown a single-minded attention on buttressing their operational capacities despite a drought - stricken economy and populace .
Although the majority of the CW stockpile in the North may not be of the more sophisticated and lethal nerve agent variety , it may contain a large quantity of casualty agents such as mustard , phosgene , and Lewisite , all compounds that are relatively easy to manufacture .

A Brief History
The inhabited history of the Las Vegas Valley stretches to 23,000 b.c. , when much of the area was covered by a prehistoric lake .
The inhabited past of the Los Nevada Valley stretches to 23,000 b.c. , when much of the area was covered by a fish water .
The inhabited record of the El Clark Valley stretches to 23,000 b.c. , when much of the area was covered by a small pool .
During this period , the indigenous people lived in caves , hunting the mammals that gathered at the shoreline .
During this time , the local humans lived in tunnels , hunting the mammals that gathered at the shoreline .
During this season , the locals persons lived in caverns , hunting the mammals that gathered at the shoreline .
The landscape of the valley changed dramatically over the next 200 centuries .
The terrain of the region changed dramatically over the next 200 years .
The geography of the canyon changed dramatically over the next 200 times .
The glaciers feeding the lake melted away and the lake evaporated .
The forests feeding the freeze melted away and the water evaporated .
The subsidies feeding the water melted away and the pond evaporated .
Fossils tell an obscure story of man 's slow and sporadic development .
Ll tell an obscure tale of man 's rapid and sporadic progress .
Time tell an obscure history of man 's rapid and sporadic advancement .
By this time , the valley was in much the same geographic state as it exists in today , with one exception -- the presence of artesian springs that bubbled to the surface in several areas .
By this period , the canyon was in much the same geographic condition as it exists in nowadays , with one odd -- the presence of artesian springs that bubbled to the surface in several areas .
By this era , the dell was in much the same geographic form as it exists in present , with one difference -- the presence of artesian springs that bubbled to the surface in several areas .
These springs fed a network of streams draining through the Las Vegas Wash to the Colorado River .
These waters fed a system of streams draining through the Las Vegas Wash to the Virgin Valley .
These streams fed a chain of streams draining through the Las Vegas Wash to the grand Water .
The areas surrounding the springs were desert oases : sprawling collections of grasses , trees , and wildlife .
The regions surrounding the baths were desert oases : sprawling collections of grasses , trees , and wildlife .
The lands surrounding the lakes were desert oases : sprawling collections of grasses , trees , and wildlife .
Many springs lay in areas that would eventually become the center of the modern Las Vegas metropolis .
Many waters lay in locations that would eventually become the heart of the modern Las Vegas metropolis .

For about 4000 years , the Archaics thrived in a culture that included many signs of early civilization .
For about 4000 bcs , the Arches thrived in a culture that included many symptoms of early civilization .
