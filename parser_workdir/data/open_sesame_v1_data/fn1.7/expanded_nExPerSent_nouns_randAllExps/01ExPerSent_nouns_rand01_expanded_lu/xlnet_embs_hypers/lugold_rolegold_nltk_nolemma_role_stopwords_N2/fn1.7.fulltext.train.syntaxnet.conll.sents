Introduction to BW Terrorism
Introduction to BW Terror
The release of nerve gas on the Tokyo subway by a Japanese cult on March 20, 1995 , the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 , and the sending of anthrax - tainted letters have made policymakers and the general public concerned that terrorists could use chemical or biological weapons ( CBW ) to inflict mass casualties .

Defining Terrorism
Defining Terror
Before assessing the threat of CBW terrorism , we need to define the word `` terrorism . ''
Before assessing the danger of CBW terrorism , we need to define the word `` terrorism . ''
Before assessing the risk of CBW terrorism , we need to define the word `` terrorism . ''
For political reasons , no single definition has been accepted worldwide and several different ones are in current use .

Terrorism experts outside government have also developed their own definitions .
Terrorism experts outside society have also developed their own definitions .
Terrorism experts outside parliament have also developed their own definitions .
For example , Walter Laqueur , a terrorism specialist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C. , defines terrorism as : `` The sub - state application of violence or threatened violence intended to sow panic in a society , to weaken or even overthrow the incumbents , and to bring about political change .

Differences between Chemical and Biological Weapons
In discussing CBW terrorism , it is important to distinguish between terrorist attacks involving chemical and biological warfare agents , which differ in several ways:

In discussing CBW terrorism , it is important to distinguish between terrorist strikes involving chemical and biological warfare agents , which differ in several ways:
Chemical warfare ( CW ) agents are non-living , manufactured chemicals that are highly toxic and can enter the body through the lungs or the skin .
Chemical war ( CW ) agents are non-living , manufactured chemicals that are highly toxic and can enter the body through the lungs or the skin .
Chemical combat ( CW ) agents are non-living , manufactured chemicals that are highly toxic and can enter the body through the lungs or the skin .
They cause illness or death within minutes to hours after exposure .
They cause illness or death within seconds to hours after exposure .
They cause illness or death within hours to hours after exposure .
Biological warfare ( BW ) agents are microorganisms such as viruses and bacteria that infect humans , livestock , or crops and cause an incapacitating or fatal disease .
Symptoms of illness do not appear immediately but only after a delay , or `` incubation period , '' that may last for days to weeks .
Symptoms of illness do not appear immediately but only after a delay , or `` incubation period , '' that may last for weeks to weeks .
Symptoms of illness do not appear immediately but only after a delay , or `` incubation period , '' that may last for hours to weeks .
Toxins -- nonliving poisons produced by living plants , insects , and animals -- are in a gray area between CW and BW agents .
They generally have an incubation period of hours to days , longer than that of CW agents but shorter than that of BW agents .

Why Would Terrorists Want to Employ CBW ?
There are several reasons why certain terrorist groups or individuals might favor the use of CBW over other kinds of weapons:
There are several motivations why certain terrorist groups or individuals might favor the use of CBW over other kinds of weapons:
If used effectively , CBW are potentially capable of inflicting a large number of casualties -- more than is possible with conventional explosives .
If used effectively , CBW are potentially capable of inflicting a large amount of casualties -- more than is possible with conventional explosives .
If used effectively , CBW are potentially capable of inflicting a large quantity of casualties -- more than is possible with conventional explosives .
CBW can have a greater psychological impact than conventional explosives , as suggested by the 2001 anthrax letter attacks , which killed only five people but frightened millions of Americans .

CBW can have a greater psychological impact than conventional explosives , as suggested by the 2001 anthrax letter attacks , which killed only five people but frightened tons of Americans .
Terrorists may seek to obtain greater status or bargaining power by demonstrating that they have the technological capabilities required to develop , produce , and deliver CBW agents .
Although CBW agents are not nearly as destructive as nuclear weapons , they are much easier and cheaper to acquire .
The psychology or ideology of a particular terrorist group or individual may lead to a fascination with poisons and disease .
The psychology or ideology of a particular terrorist group or individual may lead to a fascination with toxins and disease .
The psychology or ideology of a particular terrorist group or individual may lead to a fascination with venoms and disease .
Characteristics of CBW Terrorists
Those groups and individuals most likely to engage in terrorism with chemical or biological weapons lie at the intersection of three attributes : ( 1 ) motivation , ( 2 ) organizational structure , and ( 3 ) technical capability .
Motivation : The terrorist groups of greatest concern are motivated to inflict indiscriminate mass casualties ( random ; not targeting a specific person or persons ) and to engage in innovative and risky tactics .
Reason : The terrorist groups of greatest concern are motivated to inflict indiscriminate mass casualties ( random ; not targeting a specific person or persons ) and to engage in innovative and risky tactics .
Some groups may have a particular fascination with plagues and poisons .
Some groups may have a particular fascination with diseases and poisons .
Some groups may have a particular fascination with sicknesses and poisons .
Organizational Structure : The terrorist groups of greatest concern have an organizational structure and internal control mechanisms that enable them to prevent penetration by government agents or defection by group members .
Organizational Structure : The terrorist groups of greatest interest have an organizational structure and internal control mechanisms that enable them to prevent penetration by government agents or defection by group members .
Organizational Structure : The terrorist groups of greatest distress have an organizational structure and internal control mechanisms that enable them to prevent penetration by government agents or defection by group members .
Technical Capability : The terrorist groups of greatest concern possess the technical capability and know-how to acquire , produce , and deliver chemical or biological agents , or to recruit scientific experts in these areas .
Historically , very few terrorist groups have possessed the motivation , the organization , and the technical capability to conduct a successful chemical or biological terrorist attack , particularly on a large scale .

Although ostensibly created entirely for defensive purposes , since government and Cuban military forces in Angola were reportedly equipped for and planning to use -- if not already using -- CW agents against the South African Defence Force ( SADF ) , from the outset the program also had offensive features and capabilities .
The apartheid - era South African government viewed itself as the target of a `` total onslaught '' by Soviet-backed Marxist guerrillas or regimes in neighboring states and black nationalists at home , and to meet this all - encompassing `` red - black danger '' it was apparently willing to use almost any means at its disposal to defend itself .

Project Officer Dr . Wouter Basson also set up an elaborate network of procurement and financial front companies overseas .
During its existence Coast scientists tested and developed both small quantities of well - known CW agents ( including mustard agent , sarin , tabun , BZ , and perhaps VX ) and a host of lethal , hard - to - trace toxic chemicals .
Several of these latter , above all the toxic organophosphates , were almost certainly employed to assassinate individual `` enemies of the state . ''

Reportedly , the CW agents in the DPRK arsenal include all of the major kinds , such as phosgene ( choking ) , hydrogen cyanide ( blood ) , mustard ( blister ) and sarin ( nerve agent ) .
However , a 2002 report from the commander of U.S. Forces in Korea , General Thomas A. Schwartz , also suggests that North Korea is self - sufficient only in World War I era CW agents -- these would include compounds such as phosgene , Lewisite , and mustard blister agents , but not the more potent nerve agent classes .

According to some accounts , North Korea 's offensive CW program also began at this time , relying mostly on Chinese assistance for chemical weapons development .
Kim Il Sung 's `` Declaration for Chemicalization '' in 1961 called for the further development of a chemical industry to support chemical weapons production , and the basic organization of the current Nuclear and Chemical Defense Bureau ( NCDB ) was also established during this time .

Still , the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency ( DIA ) estimated in May 1979 that North Korea had only a defensive capability in CW , while noting that its development of offensive chemical weapons would have been the next logical step .
Finally , by the late 1980s , it was reported that North Korea was able to produce CW agents in large quantity , and deployed large numbers of chemical ordnance .
In January 1987 , the South Korean defense ministry told the South Korean press that the DPRK possessed up to 250 tons of chemical weapons , including blister ( mustard ) and nerve agents .

The DPRK is believed to maintain 2,500 to 5,000 tons of chemical agents , primarily mustard , phosgene , sarin , and V - series nerve agents. ( Other reports from DPRK defectors -- including allegations of a `` nitrogen , sulfur , and mercury '' chemical weapon that causes `` respiratory paralysis '' -- seem rather farfetched . ) Pak Tong Sam at the South Korean Agency for Defense Development has estimated that North Korea 's chemical weapons production capability is 4,500 tons annually in peacetime , and this could increase to 12,000 tons in wartime .

Due to challenges posed by a limited source of indigenously produced precursors for CW agents , it is believed that North Korea emphasizes production of phosgene , mustard , sarin , and V - agents. ( Previous reports have also alleged a large stock of sarin nerve agent. ) In 2001 , it was estimated that there are 12 facilities in the DPRK where raw chemicals , precursors , and CW agents are produced and / or stored .

`` Four secret transfers of 63 kilograms of highly enriched uranium from a research laboratory in Uzbekistan to a secure Russian reprocessing facility were completed April 19 by the U.S. Department of Energy 's National Nuclear Security Administration ( NNSA ) .
' These shipments of highly enriched uranium spent fuel are part of NNSA 's efforts to make sure this type of material does n't fall into the wrong hands , ' NNSA Administrator Linton F. Brooks said in an April 20 press release .

Although Iran 's economy is not flourishing , unemployment is high and there is a low level of internal unrest concerning the restrictive nature of the Islamic government , ballistic missile and weapons of mass destruction ( WMD ) development continue to receive very high commitments of financial and material resources -- and will likely do so for the foreseeable future .
The development of ballistic missiles and long - range artillery rockets within Iran has proceeded in a relatively steady , logical , and predictable manner .

This is an ominous development since there is little doubt that Iran perceives the ballistic missile to be the delivery system of choice for nuclear weapons .
Iran currently possesses the capability to employ ballistic missiles and/or long - range artillery rockets against its regional neighbors , Israel , and US forces deployed in the region .
Given favorable conditions , Iran is currently on track to be able to extend its ballistic missile capabilities to include Southern Europe , North Africa , and South Asia by 2005 - 2010 and possibly the continental United States by 2015 .

In 1982 , as the war dragged on into its second year , Iraqi operations entered a new phase in which it expanded the use of FROG-7As strikes and the first employment ( three attacks in 1982 ) of the Scud-B short - range ballistic missile ( SRBM ) to strike at the Iranian strategic rear .
The casualties caused by these attacks and the Iranian inability to respond in kind resulted in an effort to acquire long - range artillery rockets and ballistic missiles -- especially the Scud-B . Iran also established several indigenous ballistic missile and rocket programs .
The acquisition effort was thwarted from its inception by a number of significant factors .
The Soviet Union was then supplying Iraq with the Scud-B and those countries to which the Soviets had previously sold Scud-Bs were under contract not to transfer them to third parties .

By the end of 1982 , there appears to have been four major components -- indigenous design and production of crude artillery rockets , the indigenous design and production of a artillery rocket comparable to the FROG-7A , the acquisition of Scud-B missiles , and the reverse engineering and production of the Scud-B. The greatest obstacle to developing any indigenous capabilities was the status of the Ministry of Defense 's Defense Industries Organization ( DIO ) , and later Islamic Revolution Guard Corps ( IRGC ) Construction Jihad , industrial infrastructure .
As these components developed over the years , they would actually consist of a series of concurrent programs pursued semi - independently by the Air Force , DIO , and the IRGC Construction Jihad .
