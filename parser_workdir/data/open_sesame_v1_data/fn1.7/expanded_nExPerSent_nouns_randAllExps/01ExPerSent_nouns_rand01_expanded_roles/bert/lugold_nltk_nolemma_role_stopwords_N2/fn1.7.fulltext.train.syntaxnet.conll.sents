Jerusalem 's recorded history begins with its mention in Egyptian court records 4,000 years ago , but there had been human settlements here for centuries , probably millennia , before that .

At the beginning of the second millennium b.c. , Jerusalem was a Canaanite mountain stronghold on a secondary trade route , far less important than biblical cities such as Hazor , Megiddo , Beth Shean , and Shechem .
The earliest name associated with the city , Ur usalim , perhaps meant `` city of Shalim '' or `` founded by Shalim . ''
Scholars speculate that Shalim might have been an ancient Semitic deity of peace , for the name resembles the modern Hebrew and Arabic words for `` peace '' : shalom and salaam , respectively .
If true , this is an ironic name for a city that would become one of the most constantly and bitterly embattled places on the face of the earth .
In the Bible , Genesis 14:18 - 20 records that Abraham visited the city of `` Salem '' in approximately 1800 b.c. and was blessed by the city 's ruler , Melchzedik , who offered him bread and wine .
The city is not mentioned again in the Bible until the time of the great poet warrior , King David , who captured the city from the Jebusites in about 1000 b.c. .
The Bible describes how David 's soldiers conquered Jerusalem by discovering a water tunnel under the walls and using it to take the city by surprise .
Warren 's Shaft , part of a Canaanite water system discovered by 19th - century archaeologists and open to visitors , might be the very tunnel infiltrated by David 's army .
Perhaps because Jerusalem was in neutral territory not allotted to any of the twelve rival tribes of Israel , David made it the capital of his newly formed kingdom and brought the most talented artisans , dedicated priests , magical poets and musicians , and the most formidable soldiers from each of the tribes to live in his city .
He also brought the Ark of the Covenant , the portable tabernacle containing the Tablets of the Law received on Mount Sinai , to the Spring of Gihon , just outside the walls of Jerusalem .
There the Ark rested until it was placed in the Temple , built in approximately 960 b.c. on Mt. Moriah , the high point at the northern end of the city .
The Temple ( today known as the `` First '' Temple ) was completed by David 's son and successor , King Solomon .
According to biblical tradition , although David bought the land for the Temple and carefully assembled its building materials , he was deemed unworthy of constructing the Temple because he was a man of war with blood on his hands .

At the Temple 's dedication , Solomon addressed his God : `` ... the Heavens , even the Heaven of the Heavens , can not contain Thee ; how much less this House that I have built ? ''

Along with this splendid house of worship , Solomon built a royal palace , mansions for his wives , temples for the foreign gods worshipped by the princesses he had married , and towers for the defense of the capital .
Under the wise reign of Solomon , the city flourished as the capital of an empire that stretched from Damascus to the Red Sea and controlled the trade routes from Egypt to Phoenicia .
The Temple and royal palace were adorned with gold and ivory from Africa and with cedar from Lebanon ; the beauties and glories of Jerusalem under Solomon have captivated readers of the Bible for almost 3,000 years .

But with his death the empire collapsed , and the Israelite kingdom was divided into two separate , impoverished , often warring nations : Israel , with its capital at Shechem in the north , ruled by a series of northern dynasties ; and the smaller kingdom of Judah , with its capital at Jerusalem , from which the Davidic dynasty continued to rule .
The Bible tells us that the cruelty and impiety of the rulers of both kingdoms aroused the fury of the great Prophets .

The end of David 's dynasty came in 587 b.c. , when Nebuchadnezzar , King of Babylon , invaded Judah to lay siege to Jerusalem .
When it fell , the Temple and all the buildings were burned .
The people of the once - glorious city were forced into an exile known as `` the Babylonian Captivity . ''
In time , the kingdom of Babylon was overthrown and the Israelites were permitted to return to Jerusalem in 539 b.c. The city was now under the more tolerant rule of the Persians , but rebuilding was slow work .
The Second Temple was finished in 515 b.c. , but much of the city still lay in ruins .
Jerusalem submitted peaceably to the rule of the Greeks in 332 b.c. under Alexander the Great and , subsequently , to his Hellenistic successors as well as the Egyptian Ptolomeys and the Syrian Seleucids .

Well said the inspector with a grave and thoughtful face whoever he may have been and whatever he may have wanted he 's gone for the present and we have more immediate things to attend to
Now Mr Holmes with your permission I will show you round the house
The various bedrooms and sitting-rooms had yielded nothing to a careful search
Apparently the tenants had brought little or nothing with them and all the furniture down to the smallest details had been taken over with the house
A good deal of clothing with the stamp of Marx and Co
Telegraphic inquiries had been already made which showed that Marx knew nothing of his customer save that he was a good payer

It was a gloomy high-ceilinged room at the back of the house with a straw litter in one corner which served apparently as a bed for the cook
The table was piled with half-eaten dishes and dirty plates the debris of last night 's dinner
He held up his candle before an extraordinary object which stood at the back of the dresser

I could tell by numerous subtle signs which might have been lost upon anyone but myself that Holmes was on a hot scent

Day succeeded day and my friend took no step forward
One morning he spent in town and I learned from a casual reference that he had visited the British Museum
Save for this one excursion he spent his days in long and often solitary walks or in chatting with a number of village gossips whose acquaintance he had cultivated
I 'm sure Watson a week in the country will be invaluable to you he remarked

It is very pleasant to see the first green shoots upon the hedges and the catkins on the hazels once again

He prowled about with this equipment himself but it was a poor show of plants which he would bring back of an evening
Occasionally in our rambles we came across Inspector Baynes

His fat red face wreathed itself in smiles and his small eyes glittered as he greeted my companion
He said little about the case but from that little we gathered that he also was not dissatisfied at the course of events
I must admit however that I was somewhat surprised when some five days after the crime I opened my morning paper to find in large letters
Apparently said I as I read the following report
Great excitement was caused in Esher and the neighbouring district when it was learned late last night that an arrest had been effected in connection with the Oxshott murder
Great excitement was caused in Esher and the surrounding district when it was learned late last night that an arrest had been effected in connection with the Oxshott murder
Great excitement was caused in Esher and the nearby district when it was learned late last night that an arrest had been effected in connection with the Oxshott murder
It will be remembered that Mr Garcia of Wisteria Lodge was found dead on Oxshott Common his body showing signs of extreme violence and that on the same night his servant and his cook fled which appeared to show their participation in the crime
It was suggested but never proved that the deceased gentleman may have had valuables in the house and that their abstraction was the motive of the crime
Every effort was made by Inspector Baynes who has the case in hand to ascertain the hiding place of the fugitives and he had good reason to believe that they had not gone far but were lurking in some retreat which had been already prepared

It was certain from the first however that they would eventually be detected as the cook from the evidence of one or two tradespeople who have caught a glimpse of him through the window was a man of most remarkable appearance being a huge and hideous mulatto with yellowish features of a pronounced negroid type
This man has been seen since the crime for he was detected and pursued by Constable Walters on the same evening when he had the audacity to revisit Wisteria Lodge
Inspector Baynes considering that such a visit must have some purpose in view and was likely therefore to be repeated abandoned the house but left an ambuscade in the shrubbery
The man walked into the trap and was captured last night after a struggle in which Constable Downing was badly bitten by the savage

It seemed to me that something like a wink quivered for an instant over one of Mr Baynes 's tiny eyes

Let me show you the evolution of this case so far as I have been able to follow it
Simple as it has been in its leading features it has none the less presented surprising difficulties in the way of an arrest
We will go back to the note which was handed in to Garcia upon the evening of his death
We may put aside this idea of Baynes 's that Garcia 's servants were concerned in the matter
The proof of this lies in the fact that it was H E who had arranged for the presence of Scott Eccles which could only have been done for the purpose of an alibi
The proof of this lies in the fact that it was H E who had arranged for the presence mr Scott Eccles which could only have been done for the purpose of an alibi
The proof of this lies in the fact that it was H E who had arranged for the presence him Scott Eccles which could only have been done for the purpose of an alibi
It was Garcia then who had an enterprise and apparently a criminal enterprise in hand that night in the course of which he met his death
I say 'criminal because only a man with a criminal enterprise desires to establish an alibi
I say 'criminal because only a man without his crime interest desires to establish an alibi
I say 'criminal because only a man having this drug activity desires to establish an alibi
Surely the person against whom the criminal enterprise was directed
We can now see a reason for the disappearance of Garcia 's household
They were A L L confederates in the same unknown crime
If it came off when Garcia returned any possible suspicion would be warded off by the Englishman 's evidence and all would be well
But the attempt was a dangerous one and if Garcia did N O T return by a certain hour it was probable that his own life had been sacrificed
It had been arranged therefore that in such a case his two subordinates were to make for some prearranged spot where they could escape investigation and be in a position afterwards to renew their attempt
But why should one servant return
We can imagine that in the confusion of flight something precious something which he could not bear to part with had been left behind
Well what is the next step
Well whatever is the next step
Well who is the next step
The next step is the note received by Garcia at the dinner
It indicates a confederate at the other end
I have already shown you that it could only lie in some large house and that the number of large houses is limited
My first days in this village were devoted to a series of walks in which in the intervals of my botanical researches I made a reconnaissance of all the large houses and an examination of the family history of the occupants
My beginning days in this village were devoted to a series of walks in which in the intervals of my botanical researches I made a reconnaissance of all the large houses and an examination of the family history of the occupants

It is the famous old Jacobean grange of High Gable one mile on the farther side of Oxshott and less than half a mile from the scene of the tragedy
The other mansions belonged to prosaic and respectable people who live far aloof from romance

You see Watson we have come already upon two sets of foreigners one at Wisteria Lodge and one at High Gable so our gaps are beginning to close
These two men close and confidential friends are the centre of the household but there is one other person who for our immediate purpose may be even more important

Henderson has two children girls of eleven and thirteen
Their governess is a Miss Burnet an Englishwoman of forty or thereabouts

There are no better instruments than discharged servants with a grievance and I was lucky enough to find one
As Baynes remarks we all have our systems
It was my system which enabled me to find John Warner late gardener of High Gable sacked in a moment of temper by his imperious employer
He in turn had friends among the indoor servants who unite in their fear and dislike of their master
So I had my key to the secrets of the establishment
Curious people Watson
I don 't pretend to understand it all yet but very curious people anyway
It 's a double-winged house and the servants live on one side the family on the other
There 's no link between the two save for Henderson 's own servant who serves the family 's meals
Everything is carried to a certain door which forms the one connection
Governess and children hardly go out at all except into the garden
The gossip among the servants is that their master is terribly afraid of something
'Sold his soul to the devil in exchange for money says Warner 'and expects his creditor to come up and claim his own
Where they came from or who they are nobody has an idea
Where they came from or who they are who has an idea
Where they came from or who they are that has an idea
Twice Henderson has lashed at folk with his dog-whip and only his long purse and heavy compensation have kept him out of the courts
Well now Watson let us judge the situation by this new information
We may take it that the letter came out of this strange household and was an invitation to Garcia to carry out some attempt which had already been planned
It was someone within the citadel and it was a woman
I may add that Miss Burnet 's age and character make it certain that my first idea that there might be a love interest in our story is out of the question
If she wrote the note she was presumably the friend and confederate of Garcia
If she wrote the note he was presumably the friend and confederate of Garcia

What then might she be expected to do if she heard of his death

That was my first thought
It was his first thought
He was her first thought
Miss Burnet has not been seen by any human eye since the night of the murder
From that evening she has utterly vanished
Has she perhaps met her end on the same night as the friend whom she had summoned
Has he perhaps met her end on the same night as the friend whom she had summoned
Has they perhaps met her end on the same night as the friend whom she had summoned
Or is she merely a prisoner
Or is he merely a prisoner
Or is they merely a prisoner
You will appreciate the difficulty of the situation Watson
There is nothing upon which we can apply for a warrant
The woman 's disappearance counts for nothing since in that extraordinary household any member of it might be invisible for a week
And yet she may at the present moment be in danger of her life
All I can do is to watch the house and leave my agent Warner on guard at the gates
If the law can do nothing we must take the risk ourselves
If the law can do nothing they must take the risk ourselves

I know which is her room
It is accessible from the top of an outhouse
My suggestion is that you and I go to-night and see if we can strike at the very heart of the mystery
The old house with its atmosphere of murder the singular and formidable inhabitants the unknown dangers of the approach and the fact that we were putting ourselves legally in a false position all combined to damp my ardour

They went by the last train
The lady broke away and I 've got her in a cab downstairs

She was drugged with opium
I watched at the gate same as you advised Mr Holmes said our emissary the discharged gardener
She was like one walking in her sleep but when they tried to get her into the train she came to life and struggled

They pushed her into the carriage
I took her part got her into a cab and here we are
I shan 't forget the face at the carriage window as I led her away
We carried her upstairs laid her on the sofa and a couple of cups of the strongest coffee soon cleared her brain from the mists of the drug
Why sir you 've got me the very evidence I want said the inspector warmly shaking my friend by the hand
Why Mr Holmes when you were crawling in the shrubbery at High Gable I was up one of the trees in the plantation and saw you down below
It was just who would get his evidence first
I was sure Henderson as he calls himself felt that he was suspected and that he would lie low and make no move so long as he thought he was in any danger

Wherever the High Gable folk go he will keep them in sight

However your man picked her up and it all ends well
We can 't arrest without her evidence that is clear so the sooner we get a statement the better
But tell me Baynes who is this man Henderson
But tell me Baynes who is this man that
But tell me Baynes who is this man Alright
The whole history of the man came back to me in a flash
He had made his name as the most lewd and bloodthirsty tyrant that had ever governed any country with a pretence to civilization
Was had made his name as the most lewd and bloodthirsty tyrant that had ever governed any country with a pretence to civilization
I had made his name as the most lewd and bloodthirsty tyrant that had ever governed any country with a pretence to civilization
Strong fearless and energetic he had sufficient virtue to enable him to impose his odious vices upon a cowering people for ten or twelve years
His name was a terror through all Central America
Her name was a terror through all Central America
Their name was a terror through all Central America
At the end of that time there was a universal rising against him
At the end of that time there was a nationwide rising against him
At the end of that time there was a general rising against him
But he was as cunning as he was cruel and at the first whisper of coming trouble he had secretly conveyed his treasures aboard a ship which was manned by devoted adherents
It was an empty palace which was stormed by the insurgents next day
The dictator his two children his secretary and his wealth had all escaped them

From that moment he had vanished from the world and his identity had been a frequent subject for comment in the European press
Henderson he called himself but I traced him back Paris and Rome and Madrid to Barcelona where his ship came in in '86
They 've been looking for him all the time for their revenge but it is only now that they have begun to find him out
They 've been looking for him all the time for them revenge but it is only now that they have begun to find him out

They discovered him a year ago said Miss Burnet who had sat up and was now intently following the conversation
But another will come and yet another until some day justice will be done that is as certain as the rise of to-morrow 's sun
Her thin hands clenched and her worn face blanched with the passion of her hatred
Her thin hands clenched and his old face blanched with the passion of her hatred
Her thin hands clenched and she aged face blanched with the passion of her hatred
How can an English lady join in such a murderous affair
How can an british lady join in such a murderous affair
How can an french lady join in such a murderous affair
I join in it because there is no other way in the world by which justice can be gained
What does the law of England care for the rivers of blood shed years ago in San Pedro or for the shipload of treasure which this man has stolen
We have learned the truth in sorrow and in suffering
To us there is no fiend in hell like Juan Murillo and no peace in life while his victims still cry for vengeance
No doubt said Holmes he was as you say
This villain 's policy was to murder on one pretext or another every man who showed such promise that he might in time come to be a dangerous rival

With a premonition of his fate he had refused to take me with him
Then came the downfall of the tyrant
But the many whose lives he had ruined whose nearest and dearest had suffered torture and death at his hands would not let the matter rest
They banded themselves into a society which should never be dissolved until the work was done
It was my part after we had discovered in the transformed Henderson the fallen despot to attach myself to his household and keep the others in touch with his movements
This I was able to do by securing the position of governess in his family

Knowing that he would return there Garcia who is the son of the former highest dignitary in San Pedro was waiting with two trusty companions of humble station all three fired with the same reasons for revenge
At night however he slept alone and the avenger might find him
On a certain evening which had been prearranged I sent my friend final instructions for the man was forever on the alert and continually changed his room
I was to see that the doors were open and the signal of a green or white light in a window which faced the drive was to give notice if all was safe or if the attempt had better be postponed
In some way I had excited the suspicion of Lopez the secretary

Finally after much debate they concluded that my murder was too dangerous

The object of the mulatto cook 's return
I think that the strange creature in the kitchen may account for it
The man was a primitive savage from the backwoods of San Pedro and this was his fetish
When his companion and he had fled to some prearranged retreat already occupied no doubt by a confederate the companion had persuaded him to leave so compromising an article of furniture
But the mulatto 's heart was with it and he was driven back to it next day when on reconnoitering through the window he found policeman Walters in possession
He waited three days longer and then his piety or his superstition drove him to try once more
He waited two days longer and then his piety or his superstition drove him to try once more

I often feel as if I only get half the story sometimes , so I typically do a massive amount of reporting that is most often much more than I will ever need .
I think that is why I welcomed doing a book -- it gives one the ability to use so much of what is left on the cutting room floor of daily journalism .
Most often reporters recount these tales with each other and with their sources rather than share them with the general public .

Much of it , of course , using the standards of top newspapers , can not be used since it is largely gossip we are repeating , although it certainly could make for some very good stories .
I often wonder when a really great fictional book will be written about this era ( probably decades and decades hence as it is too close ) .
In any case , there certainly is no lack of information available about the moguls of technology now as they all become our current pop icons .
I would posit that Bill and Michael and Steve and Jerry have become the Madonnas of the current age of stock market mania and celebration of the entrepreneur .
So the shift in the image of Gates has been an interesting one for me to watch .
I personally always thought it was a risk to pin the image of Microsoft on just one man -- at AOL , for example , there was a conscious effort to develop other `` characters , '' for lack of a better word .
So there , while you think of Case , you also think of Pittman and Leonsis and increasingly a range of other executives .
Steve Ballmer , of course , is now getting a lot more attention at Microsoft , but it still seems to be Bill 's show over there .
While I did not attend the trial -- I was lucky to be able to read your highly amusing and informative dispatches , several of which made me spit up my lunch laughing -- it certainly seemed as if the image of Bill Gates took a beating and the insular culture of Microsoft did not look so good .
That 's ironic , since I think it was just that insularity that helped them , much in the same way that AOL has benefited from being in the Virginia suburbs rather than in Silicon Valley .
AOL would never have existed if it had been founded here , I am sure , since its employees would have been mocked into obscurity by the digerati .

From where I am sitting , I think the Software trial has been the really obvious turning point between the computer era and the digital age .
From where I am sitting , I think the Windows trial has been the really obvious turning point between the computer era and the digital age .
I think it almost does not matter what the judge does since it 's clear that the balance of power is shifting again , although it not clear where it will land .
Will the strongman of the era be AOL , AT and T , Microsoft , or one of the big media companies ?
Or will it be none of them because the Internet allows and encourages a plethora of strong companies and a complex interconnection of businesses where none are allowed to dominate ?
I always use two simple words when people tell me that one company -- whether it is AOL or Microsoft or Disney -- is in charge of all our destinies : Babylon was .

Countries developing clandestine nuclear weapons programs usually go to great lengths to conceal information about these programs from the outside world .
Therefore , obtaining reliable open source information on such programs is very challenging .
The lack of reliable information typically results in substantial uncertainty about the size and capabilities of these clandestine programs .
The lack of reliable information typically results in substantial uncertainty about the size and capabilities of these clan programs .
The lack of reliable information typically results in substantial uncertainty about the size and capabilities of these tribal programs .
Nonetheless , countries suspected of having clandestine nuclear weapons programs are the subject of intense scrutiny by nonproliferation analysts , intelligence agencies , and other observers .
Gradually , a fuzzy picture emerges from the analysis , albeit with some gaps in understanding .
The resulting analysis can set bounds on the uncertainties , while producing a range of estimates of the country 's capabilities .
Analytic tools include examining statements and articles in the news media , government reports including unclassified intelligence estimates , interviewing insiders who have had access to information about the clandestine program , reviewing secondary sources such as reports by analysts , and making scientific calculations based on the best available information about a country 's nuclear infrastructure .

Technical analysis of clandestine programs is based on the widely known physical and engineering aspects of nuclear materials and weapons , which enable estimates of capabilities based on fragmentary and uncertain information , as follows .
Nuclear weapons programs require specialized materials , facilities , equipment , and training in order to produce the raw material for weapons -- either highly enriched uranium ( HEU ) or plutonium -- and then to fabricate explosive devices using this fissile material .

He programs can be based on indigenous ( i.e. , domestic ) production capabilities , or they can rely on foreign supplies and technologies .
Virtually all weapons programs use some foreign inputs , if only technical information culled from scientific and engineering sources .
However , all countries known to have successfully acquired nuclear weapons have done so primarily on the basis of indigenously produced fissile material .

A plutonium - based bomb program requires capabilities to mine and mill uranium , process it into reactor fuel , transform the isotopic content of the fuel by `` burning '' it in a reactor , extract plutonium from the spent fuel , form the plutonium into the core of a fission - implosion weapon , and develop and test high explosives used to initiate fission .
Although technically sub - optimal , even reactor - grade plutonium can be used as fissile material in nuclear weapons .
Although technically sub - optimal , even reactor - grade plutonium can be used as raw material in nuclear weapons .
Although technically sub - optimal , even reactor - grade plutonium can be used as explosive material in nuclear weapons .
A uranium - based bomb program requires capabilities to mine and mill uranium , and to enrich it to weapons - grade or near - weapons - grade ( the Hiroshima bomb used less - than - weapons - grade uranium ) .
An advanced weapons program would require the capability to manufacture tritium , a radioactive gas that can be used to enhance the explosive power of nuclear weapons , for fabrication of boosted - yield weapons .
While countries may seek to develop all of these capabilities on an independent , indigenous basis , they can and often do seek some inputs from foreign sources .

While countries may seek to develop all of these capabilities on an independent , indigenous basis , they can and often do seek some inputs from international sources .
For example , they may purchase raw or milled uranium ore from abroad , and then use indigenous facilities to enrich it to weapons - grade material .
Determining how many nuclear weapons a country can produce with a given amount of fissile material requires knowing the technological sophistication of the country and the explosive yield of the weapons .
Based on data supplied by the de jure nuclear weapons states , the IAEA Safeguards Division defines quantities of concern as 8kg of plutonium and 25kg of HEU .
However , sophisticated nuclear weapons reportedly use as little as 3 - 4kg of plutonium and/or 15 - 20kg of HEU .
The Natural Resources Defense Council has estimated that a country with a `` high technical capability '' could require as little as 1kg of weapons - grade plutonium or 2.5kg HEU to produce a one kiloton bomb .
The atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki used low - level nuclear weapons technology .
The Hiroshima bomb , for example , employed about 50kg of 80% enriched uranium .
The Hiroshima bomb , for example , employed about 50kg of 80% natural uranium .
The Hiroshima bomb , for example , employed about 50kg of 80% pure uranium .
In the case of North Korea , determining the status of its nuclear weapons program is especially difficult .
As an extremely isolated and secretive state , North Korea provides few signals of the existence -- let alone the extent -- of its nuclear weapons program .
Key data sources for DPRK include defector testimony , which may be unreliable given possibility of deliberate disinformation by double agents and defectors exaggerating what they know , and unclassified estimates by US intelligence agencies , which may have certain biases based on national interest , worst - case expectations , domestic politics , etc. Also , most estimates do not rely on original texts in Korean , which may introduce some errors due to translation issues .

Around 1500 b.c. , a massive volcanic eruption at Santorini destroyed not only Akrotiri -- under feet of ash and pumice -- but the whole Minoan civilization .
Massive tidal waves swept over Crete , and other parts of the Mediterranean , smashing buildings and drowning many thousands of people .
In the wake of this tremendous natural upheaval , the Aegean Islands next came under the influence of the Mycenaeans ( at around 1300 b.c. ) , who had a base in the Peloponnese region of the Greek mainland .
The Mycenaeans were an acquisitive race who came to conquer , not to trade .
Their extensive military campaigns were later chronicled by Homer in his epic poems The Odyssey and The Iliad .
They were a barbaric race , and their custody of the area brought about a dark period during which the written word was forgotten and art disappeared .
They held sway over islands off the northern Greek coast , but the Phoenicians kept control of the main sea routes ; south of the area , trade continued as usual .
At the same time , city-states began to grow in influence on the southern Greek mainland .
Athens became the most powerful , heralding the start of the classical Greek period .
However , Greece was not yet a country ; each city-state was self-governing and autonomous .
The new culture spread throughout the Mediterranean , helped by a huge increase in migration from the mainland to new settlements such as Carthage , a Greek city on the African coast of the Mediterranean .
Culture and the arts flourished once again .

Following its victory , Athens introduced the concept of a joint defense alliance ( a kind of NATO of the ancient world ) .
Following its victory , Athens introduced the concept of a mutually defence alliance ( a kind of NATO of the ancient world ) .
Several islands and Greek city-states agreed to work together , and created a treasury to fund their plans , which was held on the island of Delos .
The alliance became known as the Delian League .
The alliance became known as the Justice League .
The alliance became known as the Ivy League .
Although there were minor internal wrangles , the league controlled the Aegean and the greater Athenian Empire for most of the fifth century b.c. .
Later , in 454 b.c. , the treasury was transferred to Athens and its deposits were used to finance the construction of many of the major buildings and temples of the Classical Age .

In 431 b.c. , Athens began a war with its neighbor and league member Sparta .
Although the islands saw little action , as the war went on they could see that Athens was slowly losing its power .
Before the end of the war in 401 b.c. , many islands had already transferred their allegiance to the victors , who were led by Philip II of Macedon .
He was followed in 336 b.c. by his son Alexander the Great , one of the most remarkable leaders in history .

In a.d. 95 , St. John arrived on Patmos , a small rocky island in the Dodecanese , as a political prisoner .
It was here that he wrote what was to become the final book of the New Testament , the Book of Revelation .
It was n't until a.d. 330 , however , when the newly converted Emperor Constantine made Byzantium , renamed Constantinople , capital of his Eastern Empire that Christianity was assured of its dominant role in future Greek life .
The Byzantine Empire had powerful and well-fortified cities , but the countryside and the outlying islands were ravaged by waves of invaders .
In an attempt to counter a threat from the Saracen Muslims , a new potent religious force from the East , the Byzantine army forcefully enlisted the men of the islands .
Disease took a further toll .
By the time of the Crusades , many of the Aegean islands had been practically depopulated .
As the Byzantine Empire weakened at the end of the first millennium , Crusader forces were sent from Western Europe to counter the Muslim forces and retake Jerusalem for the Christian faith .

While Empire land was being divided , there was no one in control of the seas , so pirates raided towns on many of the islands .
To counter this , the populations moved from their homes on the coast and built settlements inland , out of sight of the raiding parties .
This created a pattern seen today throughout the Aegean of a small port ( skala ) which serves an inland settlement or chora , making it easier to protect the island from attack .
The minor Aegean Islands were taken by various powerful European noblemen , many of whom were Genoese or Venetian , such as Marco Sanudo on Naxos .
The noblemen had free rein to create their own fiefdoms .

In return , the Turks violently put down every insurrection , including the massacre on Chios , when 22,000 people were slaughtered .
The Ottoman Empire was weakening , however , and in 1821 , the peoples of the Greek mainland achieved nationhood for the first time .
The Cyclades and the Sporades island chains were also included in this new state .
The Caroline and the other island chains were also included in this new state .
The Banks and the Greek island chains were also included in this new state .
A new sense of identity enveloped Greek peoples throughout the Aegean , thus commencing a movement to expand Greece and unify the disparate Orthodox populations .

The Turks lost a short war with Italy , and were forced to relinquish the Crete islands to the Italians .
Greece took this opportunity to absorb the islands of the northern and eastern Aegean and to add Macedonia to its mainland territories .
Following this debacle , the Ottomans then allied themselves to Germany in the World War I , losing more territory with the defeat of the Germans in that war .
Greece was handed a strip of land along the western coast of Asia Minor , which for over 2,000 years had had a substantial Greek population .
Greece moved in to administer the land , but a new influence upset any grand dreams of making this region a part of greater Greece .
In 1923 , Turkey broke away from the tired Ottoman rulers , and Kemal Ataturk rose to power on a wave of popular support .
He promised a modern state for his people , but as the situation became volatile , civil strife broke out in Turkish cities , and those considered Greek were victims of threats and violence .

Many had to leave their birthplaces , fleeing to Lesvos , Chios , and Samos , the Greek-ruled islands just offshore .
Thousands of people arrived with little more than the clothes they wore , putting great strain on the resources of the islands .
Finally , Greece was ousted from its new territory in Asia Minor , which became part of the new Turkish state .

Greece attempted to stay out of World War II , but Mussolini saw Greece as an ideal addition to his Italian empire .
His forces made a series of attacks from their bases in the Dodecanese islands , including sinking a Greek naval vessel in the harbor of Tinos Town , but they only succeeded in strengthening the resolve of the population against them .

But the country was politically fragmented , with arguments between monarchists and republicans , right and left , and tension escalated into internal war .
The struggle bypassed most of the islands , although there was fierce fighting on Samos .
Even after the fighting stopped more than a decade later , the country was not stable .
At the same time , the massive growth in air and road transport saw shipping decline in importance .
The Aegean Islands , which for centuries had been important ports on the trading routes , became the backwaters of this new transport network and the economies of several islands came close to collapse .

In 1967 , the military took the reins of power in Athens , and until 1974 , the `` Colonels '' held sway with a repressive and brutal regime .
Many Greek islanders chose to leave rather than live in poverty and terror , and many made new homes in the United States and Australia .
The expansion of air travel began the age of mass tourism , and Greece along with the Aegean Islands became exciting destinations for northern Europeans escaping their damp , cool summers .
In 1982 , Greece joined the European Common Market ( now the European Union ) .

In 1982 , Greece joined the European Common Market ( now the Europe Union ) .
Since this time , membership has been of great monetary benefit to the country .
The EU has given large subsidies to develop Greece 's infrastructure and grants to excavate and protect its ancient monuments .
Airfields have been constructed on a number of the islands , and road systems have been expanded and improved .
Private investment has even made an increasingly modern ferry fleet possible .
Politically , the 1990s have been relatively quite times for the islands , although the divorce of Greek prime minister Andreas Papandreou and his subsequent marriage to a much younger woman caused consternation within conservative Greek society .
As the Balkans flared to war once again , Greek nationalism has stirred , and there have been discussions in the kafeneion about the land of Macedonia returning to the fold of its forefathers .
Whether this will ever happen remains to be seen , but perhaps the aid offered by Greece to Turkey after 1999 's devastating earthquake is a sign that the animosity between these two traditional enemies is beginning to diminish .

Although information on WMD programs for many countries is often limited , when it comes to assessing Iran 's alleged CW program , one must sift through a mountain of information , much of which is long on allegation and short on specific , corroborated evidence .
This difficulty is compounded by the fact that much of the information can be directly traced back to just a handful of sources , none of which can be independently verified .
Most of the sources have a pre - existing bias against Iran , rendering a bulk of their information subject to speculation .

Reports of exports and leakage of Russian missile technology to countries such as Iran , India , China , Libya , and North Korea have led to concerns that Russia is contravening its obligations as a member of the Missile Technology Control Regime ( MTCR ) .
Iran 's interest in nuclear technology dates back to the US Atoms for Peace program .
In the 1950s , the Shah initiated Iran 's nuclear research program and developed an ambitious plan to produce 23,000 MW from nuclear power by the end of the century .

In 1973 , spurred by an influx of oil revenues , the Shah of Iran embarked on an ambitious goal of modernizing the country and building its image abroad .
He did this by shifting the country 's budgets toward the military and the newly established Atomic Energy Organization of Iran ( AEOI ) .
The Shah set his goal high : `` ... get , as soon as possible , 23,000 MW from nuclear power stations . ''

Also in 1976 , the government signed a $700 million contract to purchase uranium yellowcake from South Africa and sent Iranian technicians abroad for training in nuclear sciences .
In addition to his grand plans for nuclear power , the Shah placed a great emphasis on establishing and developing a nuclear research program .
Although the Shah had no specific plans to engage in research of uranium reprocessing or enrichment , the scientists at the AEOI 's newly equipped TNRC were reportedly given great discretion regarding the nature and direction of experiments conducted .
According to former head of AEOI , Akbar Etemad , the Shah 's interest in nuclear technology did not involve military applications , in fact the Shah `` considered it absurd , under the existing circumstances , to embark on anything else but a purely civilian program . ''
However , according to recently revealed documents discovered in Tehran after the revolution , in the late 1970s Iran and Israel discussed a plan to modify Israel 's surface - to - surface Jericho missiles for use by Iran -- missiles that could be equipped with nuclear weapons .
And , despite Akbar Etemad 's beliefs , the Western intelligence community had long suspected that the Shah 's nuclear scientists conducted research into military applications .

In the immediate aftermath of the revolution , Iran 's ambitious nuclear program fell apart due to the initial opposition by the Khomeini government to fusion technology and because of the exodus of many of Iran 's nuclear scientists .
Additionally , the insufficiency of the existing electrical infrastructure and dwindling oil revenues contributed to the withdrawal of foreign suppliers from Iran and the abandonment of nuclear power agreements .
Iran 's only nuclear power plants in 1979 were the two plants under construction at Bushehr , under contract with Germany 's Siemens .
The weapons research side of Iran 's nuclear activities seemed to have continued uninterrupted by the revolution , and received a major boost when a new nuclear research center opened at Isfahan in 1984 .

Invasion by Iraq and the loss of Iran 's powerful ally , the United States , must have contributed to Iran 's sense of political and military vulnerability .
Eight years of war with Iraq , multiple bombings of the Bushehr reactor site , chemical attacks on its forces , missile strikes on its cities , and an overall drain on its resources would certainly have had a devastating effect on Iran .

Eight years of war with Iraq , multiple bombings of the nuclear reactor site , chemical attacks on its forces , missile strikes on its cities , and an overall drain on its resources would certainly have had a devastating effect on Iran .
In addition to feeling threatened by Iraq 's growing nuclear program , these attacks may explain why the Khomeini government ultimately resumed its efforts to continue Iran 's nuclear power program and strengthen its existing nuclear research program -- and ultimately to develop nuclear weapons .
After the 1979 hostage crisis at the US embassy in Tehran , the United States withdrew its support from Iran , cut all nuclear cooperation agreements , and , in fact , supported Iraq during the war .

In 1990 , the Soviet Union and Iran began negotiating over the completion of the Bushehr reactors and the supply of additional radioactive plants .
In January 1995 , the Russian Federation formally announced that it would complete the construction of the Bushehr reactors and signed an agreement with Iran to build three additional reactors at the site .
Since the signing of these agreements , the United States has continuously expressed its opposition to the Bushehr deal because of fears that the deal could provide Iran with knowledge and technology to support a nuclear weapons program .
Despite many technical delays ( misfit of original Siemens equipment with Russian technology ) and efforts by the United States to stall the project , frequently by lobbying the Russia government for the cancellation of the deal , most notably during the Gore - Chernomyrdin Commission meetings , the facility is nearing completion .
Over the years , the United States has successfully blocked several of Iran 's nuclear agreements , such as those with Argentina ( uranium enrichment and heavy water production facilities ) , China ( plutonium - producing research reactor , two power reactors and a uranium conversion plant ) , and Russia ( heavy water production plant ) .
In 1995 , it became evident that Iran may be pursuing nuclear weapons through another track : by procuring dual - use items from Western firms .

In mid - 2002 , a Paris - based opposition group , the National Council of Resistance of Iran ( NCRI ) , revealed the existence of two previously unknown facilities -- a uranium enrichment facility at Natanz and a heavy water production plant at Arak .
Following the discovery of substantial reserves of uranium ore at Saghand , Yazd province , Iran announced that it was developing a nuclear power plan that would rely solely on indigenous resources .
An enrichment and heavy water production capability along with domestic resources of uranium would significantly contribute to the development of a closed nuclear fuel cycle in Iran .
Upon visiting suspected facilities in February 2003 , and with new declarations by Iran , the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) concluded that several sensitive technology facilities are either operational , under construction , or planned .

It further called on Iran to suspend all enrichment activities and sign an Additional Protocol .
In an effort to diffuse the tense relations between Iran and the IAEA and to preserve the sanctity of the nonproliferation regime , foreign ministers of Britain , France and Germany secured Iran 's consent to cooperation with the IAEA ahead of the 31 October deadline .
Faced with probability of sanctions and international isolation in case of noncompliance with the IAEA 's demands , Iran announced on 21 October 2003 that it will cooperate with the IAEA with full transparency and disclosure , sign the Additional Protocol and commence its ratification procedures , and suspend all enrichment and reprocessing activities , albeit for an `` interim period .

Comparison with the other nuclear axis member North Korea is tempting , but inappropriate .
Iran is motivated by its aspirations for political , religious , and military leadership in the region , unlike North Korea , for whom mere survival appears to be the priority .
Iran has traditionally felt insecure among its neighbors , first vis - a - vis Iraq , whom it considered its most immediate physical and ideological threat , and now that the Hussein regime is gone , the growing presence and influence of the United States .
Additionally , the constant threat of Israel 's nuclear arsenal , mostly perpetuated by Iran 's technocrats , government officials and the pro - nuclear lobby , adds to Iran 's perceived concerns and justifies it to the domestic audience the need to develop nuclear weapons .

Iran 's progress toward nuclear weapons , though irreversible , might be hampered by a combined effort on three fronts .
First , an unlikely but not impossible development would be an emergence of a domestic opposition to nuclear weapons , potentially within President Khatami 's reformist government .
A second front would come in the form of intense international pressure on states that are still in the position to help Iran perfect its knowledge and infrastructure -- Russia , Pakistan , China , and North Korea .

A second front would come in the form of increased global pressure on states that are still in the position to help Iran perfect its knowledge and infrastructure -- Russia , Pakistan , China , and North Korea .
A third approach might be a regional effort on the part of Arab states to pressure Iran to abandon sensitive technology and questionable activities in favor of a weapons - free zone in the Middle East .
Since Iran signed the Additional Protocol on Nuclear Safeguards on 18 December 2003 , the Protocol provided inspectors from the IAEA with greater access within Iran and the option to carry out intrusive inspections at Iran 's nuclear facilities .

Indeed , on 18 June 2004 , IAEA board members voted to reprimand Iran for not providing the agency with more timely and comprehensive support .
Specifically , Iran was rebuked for postponing IAEA visits to a number of locations related to Iran 's P - 2 centrifuge enrichment program , which had been scheduled to take place in March 2004 .
The IAEA also criticized Iran 's lack of forthrightness about its possession of P - 2 design drawings and other related research , and information regarding its manufacturing and mechanical testing activities , all of which was omitted from Iran 's 21 October 2003 declaration to the agency .
The IAEA called on Iran to `` be proactive in taking all necessary steps on an urgent basis to resolve all outstanding issues '' , including those related to contamination by low - enriched uranium ( LEU ) and HEU , as well as the limited production of polonium - 210 and plutonium .
Concurrently , the United States along with some other IAEA board members has continued to maintain that Iran is pursuing an underground nuclear weapons program .
And while this claim has not yet been substantiated by IAEA inspectors , proponents argue that Iran has violated the NPT and that the country 's nuclear file should , in turn , be referred to the United Nations Security Council ( UNSC ) for its review .
El - Baradei is , however , weary of pursuing such a hard line against Iran , as he fears that exerting too much pressure may cause Iran to opt out of the NPT altogether .
Responding to the barrage of critics who insist that Iran 's illicit intentions are obvious , El - Baradei has pointed to the continued absence of a `` smoking gun '' and the fundamental shortcomings of attempts to concretely assess Iran 's programmatic goals without such evidence .
For its part , Iran continues to assert that it pursues a nuclear program with only peaceful applications , while El - Baradei is steadfast in his belief that the situation may be resolved diplomatically .

Iraq has claimed that more than 1.5 million people , mostly children and the elderly , have died of curable diseases due to the decade-long U.N. sanctions .
Iraq has accused the U.S. , which vehemently opposes the lifting of the sanctions against Iraq , of using the sanctions as a tool to contain the Iraqi regime headed by President Saddam Hussein .
Earlier this year , some 70 U.S. congressmen sent a letter to U. S. President Bill Clinton , calling for an end to the humanitarian crisis in Iraq by having the sanctions lifted .

In his 19 December 2003 announcement , pledged to adhere to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty which Libya ratified in 1975 , and to sign the final Protocol , which it did on 10 March 2004 .
IAEA chief El Baradei indicated that signing the Protocol would ensure IAEA oversight over Libya 's nuclear transition from weapons creation to peaceful purposes .
Previously , Libya signed Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty in November 2001 and ratified it in January 2004 .
In , it had signed the Treaty of Pelindaba which established a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Africa .

In and December 2003 , Libyan officials took US and UK experts to a number of medical and agricultural research centers who had the potential to be used in BW research .
The country acceded to the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention on 19 January 1982 .
There are allegations that the alleged chemical weapon ( CW ) plants at Rabta and could contain BW research facilities as well .
Prior to Libya 's 19 December 2003 announcement to abandon its WMD programs , US intelligence agencies alleged that had attempted to recruit South African scientists to assist in the acquisition of BW , and that Libya had started to develop pathogens and toxins for weapons use .
There is a significant amount of open-source literature concerning Libya 's acquisition and use of chemical weapons ( CW ) ; it is well documented that Libya employed Iranian-supplied mustard gas bombs against Chad , its southern neighbor , in .
In documentation provided to US and UK authorities in , Libya revealed a `` significant quantity '' of mustard agent produced more than 10 years ago at a facility near Rabta , located in the Sahara Desert about 120 km southwest of Tripoli , along with chemical munitions and equipment needed to establish a second CW production facility .
In December 2003 , Libya pledged to eliminate all chemical weapons stocks and munitions and accede to the Chemical Weapons Convention `` without delay. ''
Libya first acquired Scud-B missiles in the early 1970 s from the Soviet Union .
In the early 1980 s , Libya accelerated its efforts to obtain a longer-range ballistic missile with the al-Fatah , reportedly with a range of 950 km .
Germany and China allegedly provided technical and material assistance to the al-Fatah program .
Germany and China allegedly provided technical and material assistance to the al program .
Germany and China allegedly provided technical and material assistance to the war program .
The al-Fatah missile system has not been completed and remains untested .
In November 2000 , as part of a $600 million agreement , Libya allegedly acquired the first shipment of a total of 50 North Korean Nodong ballistic missiles , including launch capabilities .
North Korea also allegedly provided more than 10 scientists to work on the Libyan missile program .
This complemented other missile component shipments that reportedly began in 1999 .
Also , after the lifting of the 1999 sanctions , reports of increased technical and structural assistance from countries like Iran , North Korea , China , India , and Russia have raised concerns over Libya 's growing ability to manufacture ballistic missiles .
In 2003 , US experts were given access to Libya 's missile arsenal and to a number of missile research facilities .
In December 2003 , Libya pledged to eliminate ballistic missiles capable of traveling more than 300 km with payloads of 500 kg .
Libya is not a member of the Missile Technology Control Regime ( MTCR )

Iran 's chemical weapons and ballistic missiles , and possibly its nuclear weapon program and bio warfare capabilities , are meant to deter opponents and to gain influence in the Persian Gulf and Caspian Sea regions .
The acquisition and creation of these various weapon systems can also be seen as a response to Iran 's own experience as a victim of chemical and missile attacks during the Iran - Iraq War .
Iran possesses five research reactors and two partially constructed power reactors at Bushehr .
In the mid - 1970s , Iran initiated a nuclear power program , though there are reports that it also began a small nuclear weapon research program at the same time .
In the mid - 1970s , Iran initiated a atomic power program , though there are reports that it also began a small nuclear weapon research program at the same time .
In the mid - 1970s , Iran initiated a uranium power program , though there are reports that it also began a small nuclear weapon research program at the same time .
The 1979 revolution ended all nuclear efforts until 1984 , when Iran revived the nuclear power program and reportedly began covert procurement for a nuclear weapon program .

The 1979 revolution ended all nuclear efforts until 1984 , when Iran revived the uranium power program and reportedly began covert procurement for a nuclear weapon program .
Iran 's plans for building a civilian nuclear power program have prompted much concern regarding its intention to develop nuclear weapons .
Russia is assisting Iran to construct a light water reactor at Bushehr , which is now nearing completion , and will supply the nuclear fuel needed to run it .
Although the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) allows transfers of nuclear technology for peaceful purposes to non - nuclear weapon states , the United States has vehemently opposed the Russian - Iranian deal .
The United States believes that nuclear energy is not necessary in a country with Iran 's large oil supply .
It fears that the deal is being used as a cover for the transfer of more sensitive nuclear technology to Iran and to provide training for Iranian nuclear specialists that could be used to support a nuclear weapons program .
Russia , however , has expressed its intention to complete the deal .
Iran has denied the charges that it is pursuing a nuclear weapons program , and argues that nuclear technology for civilian use is the right of every non - nuclear weapon state party to the NPT .
American concerns over Iran 's nuclear program intensified in mid - 2002 , when American intelligence learned of the existence of two secret nuclear facilities .

Americans concerns over Iran 's nuclear program intensified in mid - 2002 , when American intelligence learned of the existence of two secret nuclear facilities .
According to an Iranian opposition group , the two sites , a uranium enrichment facility at Natanz and a heavy water production plant near Arak , had been funded by front companies .
In February 2003 , Iranian leaders announced a new plan to develop a nuclear energy plan using entirely domestic resources .

The United States believes that these facilities might contribute to Iran 's development of a complete nuclear fuel cycle , which would enable Iran to build nuclear weapons without importing radioactive material .
This means that Iran will place the Natanz facility , and any enriched uranium it produces , under IAEA inspection but that , as long as no nuclear materials are present , the IAEA would have no ability to examine locations in Iran where it believed nuclear weapons design research might be under way .
The United States is concerned that if Iran stockpiled enriched uranium , it might , in the future , withdraw from the NPT ( as North Korea has ) and then build nuclear weapons rapidly , perhaps even in a matter of months .
Such a violation would have occurred if Iran introduced nuclear material into the facility to test it , without informing the IAEA .
This a violation would have occurred if Iran introduced nuclear material into the facility to test it , without informing the IAEA .

Reports in the Western media in March 2003 charged that Tehran may have taken this step .
Reports in the Western media in March 2003 charged that Azerbaijan may have taken this step .
Iran responded by strenuously denying the charges , but also maintained that it reserved the right to possess nuclear weapons to counter Israel 's weaponry .
An Iranian initiative to normalize relations was communicated to the United States in May 2003 .
It includes a promise to address U.S. concerns on nuclear weapons in exchange for lifting sanctions and eventual normalization of relations .
However , intense U.S. pressure for Iran to prove it had no secret atomic weapons program culminated in a toughly worded UN resolution in September 2003 , prompting a walkout and subsequent freeze on nuclear inspections by Iran .
In February 2004 , it was revealed that HEU traces detected by IAEA inspectors twelve months previously -- in at least two different sites -- were pure enough to produce nuclear weaponry .
In March 2004 , the revelation , combined with IAEA evidence that nuclear activities had been pursued on Iranian military bases , led to a first - ever acknowledgment by Defense Minister Ali Shamkhani that the Iranian military had produced centrifuges to enrich uranium .

In March 2004 , the revelation , combined with IAEA evidence that atomic activities had been pursued on Iranian military bases , led to a first - ever acknowledgment by Defense Minister Ali Shamkhani that the Iranian military had produced centrifuges to enrich uranium .
Iran continues to assert , however , that its nuclear program is for the generation of electricity alone .
In April 2004 , Iran vowed to step up cooperation with the IAEA , adding that it had not only suspended enrichment programs but also stopped producing and assembling related parts .
Iran agreed to an IAEA inspection schedule and to a mid - May 2004 deadline for the submission of complete details regarding its nuclear program and goals .
Iran agreed to an international inspection schedule and to a mid - May 2004 deadline for the submission of complete details regarding its nuclear program and goals .
Iran agreed to an final inspection schedule and to a mid - May 2004 deadline for the submission of complete details regarding its nuclear program and goals .
There is very little publicly available information to determine whether Iran is pursuing a biological weapon program .
Iran strongly denies acquiring or producing biological weapons .
There is limited open - source information available concerning Iran 's chemical weapons program .
Although Iran ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention ( CWC ) in November 1997 , the United States believes that Iran has maintained a chemical weapons program since 1984 , including production of sarin , mustard , phosgene , and hydrocyanic acid .
Iran strongly denies acquiring or producing chemical weapons .
Iran possesses one of the largest missile inventories in the Middle East and has acquired complete missile systems and developed an infrastructure to build missiles indigenously .
Meanwhile , Iran has also developed short - range artillery rockets and is producing the Scud-B and the Scud-C -- called the Shehab-1 and Shehab-2 , respectively .
Iran recently flight - tested the 1,300 km - range Shehab-3 , which is based on the North Korean Nodong .
Following this most recent flight - test , the Shehab-3 was placed in service and revolutionary guard units were officially armed with the missiles .
Following this most recent test - test , the Shehab-3 was placed in service and revolutionary guard units were officially armed with the missiles .
Following this most recent launch - test , the Shehab-3 was placed in service and revolutionary guard units were officially armed with the missiles .
There are conflicting reports about the development of even longer - ranged missiles , such as the Shehab-4 and the Kosar intercontinental ballistic missile ( ICBM ) .
U.S. intelligence agencies assess that barring acquisition of a complete system or major subsystem from North Korea , Iran is unlikely to launch an ICBM or satellite launch vehicle ( SLV ) before mid - decade .
At present , Iran 's capabilities in missile production have kept in line with its doctrine of protection from regional threats .
Iran has developed new missiles including the Ra'ad and Kosar and continues to test its Nodong based , Shehab-3 missile .
Iran has developed new missiles including the Ra'ad and Kosar and continues to test their Nodong based , she missile .
Iran has developed new missiles including the Ra'ad and Kosar and continues to test iranian Nodong based , Fire missile .
On October 20, 2004 , Iranian Defense Minister Ali Shamkhani confirmed the latest successful test of Iran 's Shehab-3 with a 2,000 - kilometer range in front of observers .
Iran has openly declared its ability to mass produce the Shehab-3 medium - range missile .
Iran has openly declared it ability to mass produce the Shehab-3 medium - range missile .
Iran has openly declared their ability to mass produce the Shehab-3 medium - range missile .
Intelligence reports regarding Iran 's expansion of capabilities and persistent interest in acquiring new technologies have led the United States to seek other options in dealing with Iran as a regional threat .

Introduction to BW Terrorism
The release of nerve gas on the Tokyo subway by a Japanese cult on March 20, 1995 , the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 , and the sending of anthrax - tainted letters have made policymakers and the general public concerned that terrorists could use chemical or biological weapons ( CBW ) to inflict mass casualties .
Nevertheless , numerous misconceptions persist about the nature of CBW terrorism -- in particular , how easy it would be for terrorists to produce and employ such weapons .
This tutorial addresses several aspects of biological warfare ( BW ) terrorism , with the goal of providing a greater understanding of the threat and the available policy responses .

This tutorial addresses several aspects of biological warfare ( BW ) terrorism , with the goal of providing a broader understanding of the threat and the available policy responses .
How vulnerable is the United States to BW terrorism , and what types of attacks should it be most concerned about ?
How vulnerable is the United States to international terrorism , and what types of attacks should it be most concerned about ?
How vulnerable is the United States to global terrorism , and what types of attacks should it be most concerned about ?
Further , what can be done to prevent or reduce the likelihood of incidents of BW terrorism ?
The tutorial is organized into six chapters .
This introductory chapter defines CBW terrorism , explores what types of terrorist groups would be most likely to carry out such attacks , and summarizes U.S. government actions to combat CBW terrorism before and after September 11 .
The next five chapters focus on the technical aspects of biological terrorism , including the biological agents of greatest concern ; the technical hurdles associated with their acquisition , production , and delivery ; historical cases of bioterrorism ; and approaches to the prevention and mitigation of bioterrorist incidents .

Defining Terrorism
Before assessing the threat of CBW terrorism , we need to define the word `` terrorism . ''
For political reasons , no single definition has been accepted worldwide and several different ones are in current use .
For political reasons , no single definition has been accepted worldwide and several different ones are in currently use .
For political reasons , no single definition has been accepted worldwide and several different ones are in present use .
The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) defines terrorism as : `` The unlawful use of force and violence against persons or property to intimidate or coerce a government , the civilian population , or any segment thereof , in furtherance of political or social objectives . ''
The U.S. State Department defines terrorism differently , as : `` Premeditated , politically motivated violence perpetrated against noncombatant targets by sub - national groups or clandestine agents , usually intended to influence an audience . ''
Terrorism experts outside government have also developed their own definitions .
For example , Walter Laqueur , a terrorism specialist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C. , defines terrorism as : `` The sub - state application of violence or threatened violence intended to sow panic in a society , to weaken or even overthrow the incumbents , and to bring about political change . ''
Some definitions of terrorism go beyond sub - state actors to include repressive governments that may carry out acts of `` state terrorism '' against their own citizens .
The lack of a universally accepted definition of terrorism has allowed political leaders to manipulate the term for propaganda purposes .
During the Cold War , for example , the United States and the Soviet Union each supported sub - national groups engaged in proxy wars .
The United States called the groups it supported `` freedom fighters '' ( such as the contras in Nicaragua and the mujahideen in Afghanistan ) , while labeling the groups supported by the Soviet Union as `` terrorists '' ( such as the Palestinian Liberation Organization ) .
The Soviets , of course , described the same groups in exactly opposite terms .
For the purposes of this tutorial , however , the term `` terrorism '' will be used to describe acts that incorporate the following elements : Intentional or threatened violence directed against civilians or noncombatants ; Actors that are sub - national groups or individuals ( although they may receive financial or logistical support from governments ) ; Motivations that are chiefly political , ideological , or religious ( i.e. , not strictly criminal ) ; Often , some element of symbolism in the choice of target , together with the desire to elicit fear in a larger audience beyond the immediate victims of an attack .

In discussing CBW terrorism , it is important to distinguish between terror attacks involving chemical and biological warfare agents , which differ in several ways:
Chemical warfare ( CW ) agents are non-living , manufactured chemicals that are highly toxic and can enter the body through the lungs or the skin .
Was warfare ( CW ) agents are non-living , manufactured chemicals that are highly toxic and can enter the body through the lungs or the skin .
I warfare ( CW ) agents are non-living , manufactured chemicals that are highly toxic and can enter the body through the lungs or the skin .
They cause illness or death within minutes to hours after exposure .
Biological warfare ( BW ) agents are microorganisms such as viruses and bacteria that infect humans , livestock , or crops and cause an incapacitating or fatal disease .
Symptoms of illness do not appear immediately but only after a delay , or `` incubation period , '' that may last for days to weeks .
Toxins -- nonliving poisons produced by living plants , insects , and animals -- are in a gray area between CW and BW agents .
They generally have an incubation period of hours to days , longer than that of CW agents but shorter than that of BW agents .
They generally have an incubation period of hours to days , longer than that of CW agents but shorter than that of Ab agents .
They generally have an incubation period of hours to days , longer than that of CW agents but shorter than that of Cb agents .
Chapters 2 - 6 discuss the technical issues of biological terrorism in greater detail .
Why Would Terrorists Want to Employ CBW ?
There are several reasons why certain terrorist groups or individuals might favor the use of CBW over other kinds of weapons:
If used effectively , CBW are potentially capable of inflicting a large number of casualties -- more than is possible with conventional explosives .
If used effectively , CBW are potentially capable of inflicting a significant number of casualties -- more than is possible with conventional explosives .
If used effectively , CBW are potentially capable of inflicting a massive number of casualties -- more than is possible with conventional explosives .
CBW can have a greater psychological impact than conventional explosives , as suggested by the 2001 anthrax letter attacks , which killed only five people but frightened millions of Americans .
Terrorists may seek to obtain greater status or bargaining power by demonstrating that they have the technological capabilities required to develop , produce , and deliver CBW agents .
Although CBW agents are not nearly as destructive as nuclear weapons , they are much easier and cheaper to acquire .
Although Cb agents are not nearly as destructive as nuclear weapons , they are much easier and cheaper to acquire .
Although Ab agents are not nearly as destructive as nuclear weapons , they are much easier and cheaper to acquire .
The psychology or ideology of a particular terrorist group or individual may lead to a fascination with poisons and disease .

Those groups and individuals most likely to engage in terrorism with chemical or biological agents lie at the intersection of three attributes : ( 1 ) motivation , ( 2 ) organizational structure , and ( 3 ) technical capability .
Motivation : The terrorist groups of greatest concern are motivated to inflict indiscriminate mass casualties ( random ; not targeting a specific person or persons ) and to engage in innovative and risky tactics .
Some groups may have a particular fascination with plagues and poisons .
Organizational Structure : The terrorist groups of greatest concern have an organizational structure and internal control mechanisms that enable them to prevent penetration by government agents or defection by group members .
Organizational Structure : The terrorist groups of least concern have an organizational structure and internal control mechanisms that enable them to prevent penetration by government agents or defection by group members .
Organizational Structure : The terrorist groups of highest concern have an organizational structure and internal control mechanisms that enable them to prevent penetration by government agents or defection by group members .
Technical Capability : The terrorist groups of greatest concern possess the technical capability and know-how to acquire , produce , and deliver chemical or biological agents , or to recruit scientific experts in these areas .
Technical Capability : The terrorist groups of greatest concern possess the technical capability and know-how to acquire , produce , and deliver chemical or chemical agents , or to recruit scientific experts in these areas .
Technical Capability : The terrorist groups of greatest concern possess the technical capability and know-how to acquire , produce , and deliver chemical or biology agents , or to recruit scientific experts in these areas .
Historically , very few terrorist groups have possessed the motivation , the organization , and the technical capability to conduct a successful chemical or biological terrorist attack , particularly on a large scale .
Some groups in the past have tried to acquire a CBW capability , but have lacked the technical expertise to do so .
Some groups in the past have tried to acquire a Cb capability , but have lacked the technical expertise to do so .
Some groups in the past have tried to acquire a Radio capability , but have lacked the technical expertise to do so .
Other groups have acquired a pathogen or toxin and have been motivated to use it , but were penetrated by law enforcement or exposed by defectors before the attack could be carried out .
Is the number of groups capable of CBW terrorism increasing ?
Even before the events of September 11 and the anthrax letter attacks of fall 2001 , analysts began to observe some troubling developments along all three dimensions of the CBW terrorism threat .
A few terrorist groups active today are more motivated to carry out mass - casualty attacks , better organized to resist outside penetration , and are actively pursuing technologies and know-how relevant to CBW terrorism .
Yet although small terrorist cells may be more motivated to use CBW and harder for counterterrorism authorities to interdict , they may lack the technical and financial resources needed to produce and deliver CBW agents .

Motivation
In the past , politically motivated terrorist organizations , such as the Provisional Irish Republican Army ( PIRA ) or the Palestinian Liberation Organization ( PLO ) , have not sought to inflict indiscriminate mass casualties .
In the past , politically motivated militant organizations , such as the Provisional Irish Republican Army ( PIRA ) or the Palestinian Liberation Organization ( PLO ) , have not sought to inflict indiscriminate mass casualties .
In the past , politically motivated terror organizations , such as the Provisional Irish Republican Army ( PIRA ) or the Palestinian Liberation Organization ( PLO ) , have not sought to inflict indiscriminate mass casualties .
Such groups engage in violent attacks against civilian targets with the aim of influencing public opinion and applying pressure on government officials .
Nevertheless , it would be counterproductive for politically motivated terrorists to inflict too many casualties , for two reasons:
These groups have an outside constituency that would be alienated by indiscriminate or disproportionate attacks , potentially triggering a political backlash .
Mass - casualty attacks would provoke government authorities to pursue the terrorists so aggressively that they would ultimately be destroyed as a viable organization .
Was - casualty attacks would provoke government authorities to pursue the terrorists so aggressively that they would ultimately be destroyed as a viable organization .
I - casualty attacks would provoke government authorities to pursue the terrorists so aggressively that they would ultimately be destroyed as a viable organization .
Over the past few decades , however , a `` new breed '' of terrorists has come on the scene .
Over the recent is decades , however , a `` new breed '' of terrorists has come on the scene .
Over the last that decades , however , a `` new breed '' of terrorists has come on the scene .
In general , these groups are more prepared to inflict indiscriminate casualties because they are not driven by specific political goals but rather by irrational belief systems , extremist ideologies ( such as neo - Nazism ) , apocalyptic prophecy ( predicting the end of the world ) , or religious fundamentalism .

Religious Terrorism
Christian Terrorism
Holy Terrorism
Whereas most terrorist groups during the 1960s and 1970s were motivated either by left-wing ideology ( socialist / communist policies advocated by Marxist - Leninist or Maoist groups ) or by national - separatist goals ( a group 's pursuit to become an independent state based on its ethnic , racial , or cultural make-up ) , the number of groups characterized primarily by religious beliefs began to increase in the 1980s .
According to terrorism analyst Bruce Hoffman , in 1968 , none of the 11 major terrorist organizations then active was religiously motivated .

According to terror analyst Bruce Hoffman , in 1968 , none of the 11 major terrorist organizations then active was religiously motivated .
By 1995 , however , 26 out of 56 known , active international terrorist groups could be classified as religious in character and / or motivation .
Such groups either promote extreme forms of the world 's major religions or entirely `` new '' belief systems , usually in the form of cults .
Examples include the Aum Shinrikyo cult in Japan and The Covenant , the Sword , and the Arm of the Lord ( CSA ) in the United States .
Religiously motivated terrorist groups are more likely than political terrorists to resort to non - conventional weapons for the following reasons:
They may view extreme violence as divinely sanctioned and the fulfillment of God 's commandments .
They are largely unaffected by public opinion because they act on behalf of their deity and their co - religionists .
They are largely unaffected by popular opinion because they act on behalf of their deity and their co - religionists .
They are largely unaffected by governmental opinion because they act on behalf of their deity and their co - religionists .
They may believe in apocalyptic prophecy and actively seek to bring about Armageddon , or the end of the world .
Single - Issue Terrorism
Another new type of terrorist organization focuses on a single , hotly disputed issue such as abortion , animal rights , environmental protection , or genetic engineering .
Another emerging type of terrorist organization focuses on a single , hotly disputed issue such as abortion , animal rights , environmental protection , or genetic engineering .
Another growing type of terrorist organization focuses on a single , hotly disputed issue such as abortion , animal rights , environmental protection , or genetic engineering .
Members of these groups feel passionately about their chosen issue and are prepared to strike out violently against those who disagree with them .
The Army of God , for example , is an extremist anti - abortion group that has assassinated doctors who perform abortions and has sent hundreds of anthrax hoax letters to family - planning clinics around the United States .
Right Wing Terrorism
The 1990s saw the rise of right - wing terrorism , including neo - Nazis and neo - Fascists in Europe and white supremacists and anti - government ( `` Patriot '' ) organizations in the United States .
The Patriot movement subscribes to a conspiratorial world-view in which the federal government is in league with Jewish bankers to deprive ordinary Americans of their land and liberty .
The Patriot movement subscribes to a conspiratorial world-view in which the national government is in league with Jewish bankers to deprive ordinary Americans of their land and liberty .
The Patriot movement subscribes to a conspiratorial world-view in which the central government is in league with Jewish bankers to deprive ordinary Americans of their land and liberty .
Patriot groups in rural areas often form armed militias that stockpile weapons and conduct training exercises in preparation for an anticipated violent showdown with the federal government or United Nations forces .
These confrontations are not purely in the realm of fantasy , however .
Several highly publicized clashes between federal authorities and local armed groups have occurred over the past decade , including the confrontation between Randy Weaver and federal marshals at Ruby Ridge , Idaho , on August 21 - 22, 1992 , during which Weaver 's son and wife were killed ; and the disastrous siege by federal agents of the Branch Davidian compound in Waco , Texas , in April 1993 .
In the United States , right - wing extremism is often linked to the Christian Identity church , a twisted form of Christianity that is bitterly racist and anti - Semitic .

In the United States , right - wing extremism is often linked to the Christian Identity church , a reformed form of Christianity that is bitterly racist and anti - Semitic .
Members of the church believe that whites are the real children of Israel , Jews are the evil offspring of Satan or Cain , and blacks and other racial minorities are sub - human .
Some Christian Identity groups believe in apocalyptic prophecy , including the `` purifying '' role of biblical plagues to vanquish sinners and help bring about Armageddon and the Second Coming .
Some subscribers to Patriot and Christian Identity ideology are not formal members of right - wing groups .
Instead , they constitute what terrorism analyst Jerrold Post has called a `` community of belief , '' linked through email and Internet websites rather than direct interpersonal contact .
Timothy McVeigh , who perpetrated the April 1995 bombing of the federal building in Oklahoma City , was not a member of a Patriot organization but identified strongly with the anti - government community of belief .
Al Qa'ida ( Arabic for `` The Base `` ) is a loosely connected global network of Islamic terrorist groups that seek to expel U.S. troops from the Middle East , inflict revenge for what they perceive as America 's attacks on Muslims and its one - sided support of Israel , and eliminate Western cultural influences they consider contrary to Islam .
Many Al Qa'ida terrorists are prepared to sacrifice their own lives to carry out attacks , making them essentially impossible to deter .
On September 11, 2001 , nineteen Al Qa'ida terrorists hijacked four commercial aircraft and flew three of them into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon ; the fourth crashed into a field in Shanksville , Pennsylvania .
This single incident caused more than 3,000 deaths .
Shaped by a fanatical worldview , the terrorists sought to kill as many Americans as possible while striking at symbolic targets of U.S. economic and military power .
Shaped by a fanatical worldview , the terrorists sought to kill as many Americans as possible while striking at symbolic targets of united economic and military power .
Shaped by a fanatical worldview , the terrorists sought to kill as many Americans as possible while striking at symbolic targets of States economic and military power .
The September 11 attacks were also characterized by innovative tactics , impressive execution , and a sharp escalation in the level of violence .
A few pieces of evidence suggest that Al Qa'ida is interested in acquiring chemical and biological weapons .
The network 's mastermind , Osama bin Laden , has stated openly that it is his `` religious duty '' to acquire weapons of mass destruction .
In March 2002 , U.S. troops in Afghanistan found an abandoned laboratory under construction near Kandahar where Al Qa'ida members apparently planned to develop biological agents .
In August 2002 , the Cable News Network ( CNN ) broadcast an Al Qa'ida training video showing experiments on dogs with cyanide gas .
In August 2002 , the Cable News Network ( CNN ) broadcast an Al Qa'ida training video showing experiments on dogs with carbon gas .

On March 1, 2003 , documents and computer hard drives were seized during the capture of Khalid Shaikh Mohammed , a key operational planner for Al Qa'ida .
These materials revealed that the organization had recruited a Pakistani microbiologist , acquired materials to manufacture botulinum toxin , and developed a workable plan for anthrax production .

These materials revealed that the organization had recruited a Pakistani microbiologist , acquired materials to manufacture botulinum toxin , and developed a workable plan for ants production .
No evidence obtained to date suggests that Al Qa'ida has actually succeeded in producing significant quantities of chemical or biological agents or developed an effective means of delivery , but the intention to do so is clearly present .

Rare species of butterflies and delicate hummingbirds take to the air , and crocodiles and manatees still live in and around vast tracts of mangrove swamp in the south .
The island is surrounded by coral reefs and reef walls , which provide shelter to hundreds of species of sea creatures and recreation to divers and snorkelers .
Temperatures here vary only a few degrees from about 27 C ( 80 F ) , although the heat is tempered by the nearly continuous trade winds that blow across the Atlantic .
In the mountains and hills of the interior , the temperature drops with altitude and with the clouds that wrap around the highest peaks .
Much of the land is extremely fertile and produces a range of tropical fruit and vegetable crops , providing ample food for the people and such lucrative cash crops as sugar and coffee .
Four hundred years ago these crops brought British colonists to rule the land and African slaves to work it .

They have been melded together , giving rise to a fascinating national identity .
Since independence in 1962 , the black majority has worked to create a country based on confidence from within , working on a principle of pride in oneself and in one 's roots .
This is so important for the future of the country that the national motto is `` Out of many one people . ''
It says much about the character of the Jamaican people that they have slightly changed the story of Columbus and his trip to the island in 1493 .

In actuality , it was the population of Jamaica who discovered him Columbus was really lost , thinking that he had found another route to Asia .
Vestiges of the British colonial legacy can still be found , not least in the fact that English is Jamaica 's official language : the popularity of cricket is another example .

And as far as cricket is concerned , Caribbean players have turned the tables on their colonial mentors and now produce some of the best players in the world , easily capable of soundly outplaying the Brits .
In recent years the influence of the United States has been much stronger than that of Britain .
Many Jamaicans head to the States for further education , and the American economic influence on areas such as business investment and planning is growing .
Its no surprise that the US dollar is accepted as readily as the Jamaican dollar to pay for goods .

It still revels in its own identity , which is now internationally recognized through such influential cultural products as the Rastafarian religion and reggae music .

There 's nothing they like better than having a good chat about the latest bit of gossip : who is doing what , where , and why .
They are very direct in their dealings with each other , as you might discover if you come across a friendly conversation among a group of friends .

Instead , be prepared for a barrage of questions about your life , offers to supply anything you need , a host of jokes at your expense , and some serious flirting if you 're single .
Having some lines ready to throw back at them induces guffaws of laughter and an appreciative slap on the back .
The recreational pleasures that ordinary islanders enjoy have become synonymous with the name Jamaica : dancing to the heavily rhythmic musical beat ; taking a little marijuana ( or `` ganja , '' as it 's known here ) , which many Jamaicans view as a kind of medicinal herb ; or simply sitting back and chatting with friends on a bench or street corner , where the situation is described as `` Irie '' the equivalent of `` Everything 's just fine !

The popular phrase `` Soon come '' indicates an apparent lack of concern about time and an unhurried attitude to daily tasks .
Occasional hurricanes can spoil the idyllic climate and contribute to this `` laid back '' attitude : Jamaicans are aware that circumstances can suddenly alter dramatically and yet life will always carry on .
To have to wait a while for something is not the worst problem in the world .
Since independence in 1962 , tourism has been Jamaica 's primary industry and the island has become renowned as one of the prime destinations in the Caribbean .

All-inclusive packages and large resort hotels offer restaurants , sporting activities , entertainment , wide - screen sports channels in the bars , shopping , and a guaranteed suntan .
There is frequently a temptation never to tear oneself away from the hotel .
Yet to do this is to miss the very essence of what the island is all about .
Step out of the hotel and your senses will be bombarded by a range of sights , sounds , smells , tastes , and textures that let you know that you could only be in Jamaica .
Such sights include the colorful `` tams '' -- knitted hats worn by Jamaican men to cover their mane of dreadlocks -- and the red ackee fruit that ripens at the beginning of the year .

Sample the taste of ackee cooked with saltfish , Jamaica 's national dish , and the smell of hot jerk pork cooked in a pit barbecue .
Hear the songs of Bob Marley booming from a hundred cranked - up car stereos or the chorus of frogs that begin to call as evening descends .
Feel the texture of a hand offered in greeting and try to fathom the `` Jamaican handshake , '' a ritual whose rules seem to be more complex than those of the game of cricket .
Of course Jamaica has its palm - lined beaches and almost endless rum drinks , and you can enjoy a wonderful resort - based break .
There 's an abundance of nature , history , art , and modern culture to be explored and enjoyed .
Jamaica is an island with a strong personality that does n't simply wait in the wings .

The fire is the largest forestry fire to occur in Norway since World War II .
The fire has spread extensively and it is estimated that approximately 2,500 acres of forest have been damaged .
Approximately 15 cabins are reported to have burned to the ground , but as of yet , no permanent dwellings or farms have been damaged .
However , many inhabitants have been evacuated due to the fire threatening their homes , including the entire villages of Mykland and Belland .
Approximately 140 persons , including fire-fighters from several fire departments , and personnel from the Civil Defence and the Home Guard are working to curtail the fire .
Four fire helicopters have been deployed .
The fire fighting is focused on areas where the fire threatens buildings .
Extremely dry weather , and difficult wind conditions , have caused severe difficulties in fighting the fire .

Extremely dry weather , and difficult wind conditions , have caused extensive difficulties in fighting the fire .
Fire-fighters first had hope of gaining control on the morning of Thursday , June 12 , but the wind changed direction during the day , causing a large extension of the fire .
There is some hope that the weekend will bring some rain ; however , this will likely not be enough to stop the fire .
It could take several weeks before the fire is completely extinguished .

Four people have perished so far in the blazes which the government says were started intentionally by arsonists over a week ago .
Police have arrested twenty -four people on suspicion of starting the fires .
Among those being detained is a ninety-four year-old man .
'' Those arrested are people who knew exactly what they were doing , knew they were committing crimes and went up into the hills to start fires , sometimes more than one , '' said the president of Galicia 's regional government , Emilio Perez Tourino .

Pretoria developed nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles but relinquished these armaments in the early 1990s .
The apartheid government also undertook a chemical and biological weapons ( CBW ) defense program , which reportedly also included offensive research and use of CBW agents against opponents of that government .
While the proliferation legacies of South Africa 's nuclear and missile programs were effectively resolved through verified disarmament measures that won international acclaim , dismantlement of the country 's CBW capabilities was not verified to a comparable degree of certainty .
The post - apartheid government of South Africa implemented its nonproliferation and disarmament policy through the Non - Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction Act ( No. 87 of 1993 ) to control the transfer of sensitive items and technologies .

South Africa 's biological weapons program was one of the two principal components of its covert state - sponsored CBW program , codenamed Project Coast ( later Project Jota ) .
Personnel associated with Coast have characterized it as the most sophisticated program of its type outside of the former Soviet Union , but international CBW experts generally consider it to have been considerably less advanced from a scientific standpoint .

Although ostensibly created entirely for defensive purposes , since government and Cuban military forces in Angola were reportedly equipped for and planning to use -- if not already using -- CW agents against the South African Defence Force ( SADF ) , from the outset the program also had offensive features and capabilities .
The apartheid - era South African government viewed itself as the target of a `` total onslaught '' by Soviet-backed Marxist guerrillas or regimes in neighboring states and black nationalists at home , and to meet this all - encompassing `` red - black danger '' it was apparently willing to use almost any means at its disposal to defend itself .
The chief facility for researching , producing , and testing BW agents and lethal toxic chemicals was a military front company called Roodeplaat Research Laboratories , located north of Pretoria , and other facilities were established to develop protective clothing and manufacture exotic assassination devices .

Some of these pathogens were probably used to assassinate individual `` enemies of the state , '' and it is alleged that both anthrax bacteria and V. cholerae were each employed on at least one occasion to infect larger populations .
There are indications , however , that certain personnel who were intimately involved in the program , including Basson , may have provided technical knowledge , equipment , or materials to `` rogue regimes '' such as Libya , to foreign intelligence personnel , to unscrupulous black marketers trafficking in dangerous weapons , and perhaps also -- if certain journalists can be believed -- to elements of a shadowy international network of right - wing extremists .

The chief facility for researching and producing CW agents was a military front company called Delta G Scientific , located between Johannesburg and Pretoria , and several other facilities were set up to develop protective clothing , manufacture exotic assassination devices , and `` weaponize '' irritants ( Riot Control Agents such as CS and CR ) and incapacitants by placing them in artillery shells , mortar bombs , and grenades .
Project Officer Dr . Wouter Basson also set up an elaborate network of procurement and financial front companies overseas .
During its existence Coast scientists tested and developed both small quantities of well - known CW agents ( including mustard agent , sarin , tabun , BZ , and perhaps VX ) and a host of lethal , hard - to - trace toxic chemicals .

During its existence Coast scientists tested and developed both small quantities of well - known deadly agents ( including mustard agent , sarin , tabun , BZ , and perhaps VX ) and a host of lethal , hard - to - trace toxic chemicals .
Several of these latter , above all the toxic organophosphates , were almost certainly employed to assassinate individual `` enemies of the state . ''
Certain CW facilities also carried out research on the suitability of using illegal drugs such as methaqualone ( `` Quaaludes '' ) , MDMA ( `` Ecstasy '' ) , LSD , marijuana extract ( tetrahydrocannibol ) , and cocaine as incapacitating `` calmatives , '' but some of these illegal drugs may have ended up being sold for a profit .

Missile
It is not clear when South Africa began ballistic missile - related efforts , but reportedly by the mid - 1980s , some missile infrastructure existed in the country .
It appears that Israel collaborated with South Africa in development of this program , but the nature and extent of this relationship is unknown .
Following a July 1989 flight - test of what Pretoria described as a `` booster rocket '' in a space - launch program , U.S. intelligence noted striking similarities between this system and Israel 's intermediate - range Jericho - 2 ballistic missile .

At night the streets are crowded with people bent on having a good time .
Prosperity is in the air ; the roar of the `` Celtic Tiger `` can clearly be heard .
The proverbial hospitality and warm welcome are still here .
This busy , modern European city sits on a thousand years of history -- history is present everywhere , from elegant Merrion Square to the bullet holes on the General Post Office .
It 's also a city of the imagination , reinvented and reappraised in the literature of its exiles .
And the old Dublin is with us , too -- the irreverent city of wit and charm and that peculiar magic possessed by Ireland and the Irish .
Prosperity has brought with it a new emphasis on historic preservation .
Dublin excels in packaging its past for the visitor .
You can view artifacts from the Bronze Age , trace the history of the Easter Rising , or revisit Leopold Bloom 's odyssey in Ulysses .
Old buildings are being recycled ; for example , the 17th-century Royal Hospital now holds the Museum of Modern Art .
And Dublin , a city large in expectations , is still small enough for the visitor to see most of its sights on foot .
City on the Liffey
The River Liffey flows from west to east through the center of the city to Dublin Bay .
The river forms a natural line between the north and south sections of the city .
Historically and culturally this north-south distinction has always been significant , and it still is today , with a dose of good-humored rivalry between the two areas .

Literature has always flourished in Dublin , the only city to have produced three Nobel Prize winners for literature -- Yeats , Shaw , and Beckett .
Joyce , the high priest of literary Modernism , imagined and interpreted Dublin for the world in Ulysses ( you 'll see references to it all over ) .
However , sometimes it seems that the city produced artists of this stature by accident , even against its will .
Beckett and Joyce , among others , had to leave their homeland to understand it -- and to be understood .

Dublin theater is legendary , and no visitor should miss seeing a performance at the Abbey Theatre or Gate Theatre .
The city 's impact on the rock and pop music scene with the likes of U2 and Bob Geldof is well known -- there 's even a self-guided tour of their haunts .
Traditional Irish music is also alive and well , especially in the pubs , and there has been a revival of storytelling , poetry reading , and traditional dancing .
And in this city , where literature and theater have historically dominated the scene , visual arts are finally coming into their own with the new Museum of Modern Art and the many galleries that display the work of modern Irish artists .

Dublin 's food has undergone a metamorphosis .
Dublin has international restaurants galore , and the New Irish Cuisine is built upon fresh products of Ireland 's seas , rivers , and farms .
Coffee has replaced the ubiquitous tea -- Dublin is now almost as much a coffee city as Vienna or Seattle .
City and Countryside
In a city of such human proportions it is not surprising that parks and gardens abound for recreation and relaxation .
Phoenix Park in the northwest is the largest open space , but squares like St . Stephen 's Green are the garden oases of the city .

This assessment ranks North Korea among the largest possessors of chemical weaponry in the world .
If official reports and testimonies from North Korean defectors are to be believed , the DPRK military possesses between 2,500 and 5,000 tons of chemical weapons .
It is not clear , however , if this amount includes the munitions or only the CW agents themselves .
Reportedly , the CW agents in the DPRK arsenal include all of the major classes , such as phosgene ( choking ) , hydrogen cyanide ( blood ) , mustard ( blister ) and sarin ( nerve agent ) .

However , a 2002 report from the commander of U.S. Forces in Korea , General Thomas A. Schwartz , also suggests that North Korea is self - sufficient only in World War I era CW agents -- these would include compounds such as phosgene , Lewisite , and mustard blister agents , but not the more potent nerve agent classes .

However , it would appear that over the last 20 years , the DPRK has increased its capacity not only in CW agent production but also the development and deployment of a variety of chemical delivery systems .
According to defector accounts , the DPRK 's long - range missiles such as the Nodong , and other ballistic rockets and artillery pieces with calibres larger than 80 mm , are capable of delivering CW agents .
Despite North Korea 's moribund economy and some hints of softening rhetoric from its leadership , the quantity and quality of new artillery placed near the Demilitarized Zone ( DMZ ) have actually increased in the last several years .

It noted the utility of forcing the enemy to `` suit up '' in preparation for real or imagined use of chemical agents , for doing so would degrade the fighting ability of enemy forces .
According to some accounts , North Korea 's offensive CW program also began at this time , relying mostly on Chinese assistance for chemical weapons development .
Kim Il Sung 's `` Declaration for Chemicalization '' in 1961 called for the further development of a chemical industry to support chemical weapons production , and the basic organization of the current Nuclear and Chemical Defense Bureau ( NCDB ) was also established during this time .

In 1966 , for reasons that are unclear , the DPRK later turned to the Soviets for assistance in CW , mostly in the form of training manuals and small quantities of nerve and mustard agents .
Following this period of Soviet - led assistance , North Korea made substantive gains in the area of chemical warfare .
Still , the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency ( DIA ) estimated in May 1979 that North Korea had only a defensive capability in CW , while noting that its development of offensive chemical weapons would have been the next logical step .

The Suspected North Korean Chemical Weapons Arsenal
The DPRK is believed to maintain 2,500 to 5,000 tons of chemical agents , primarily mustard , phosgene , sarin , and V - series nerve agents. ( Other reports from DPRK defectors -- including allegations of a `` nitrogen , sulfur , and mercury '' chemical weapon that causes `` respiratory paralysis '' -- seem rather farfetched . ) Pak Tong Sam at the South Korean Agency for Defense Development has estimated that North Korea 's chemical weapons production capability is 4,500 tons annually in peacetime , and this could increase to 12,000 tons in wartime .
An unknown portion of CW agents are stored in bulk , but a significant portion is reported to be filled into artillery shells and rocket warheads .
Due to challenges posed by a limited source of indigenously produced precursors for CW agents , it is believed that North Korea emphasizes production of phosgene , mustard , sarin , and V - agents. ( Previous reports have also alleged a large stock of sarin nerve agent. ) In 2001 , it was estimated that there are 12 facilities in the DPRK where raw chemicals , precursors , and CW agents are produced and / or stored .

CW agents are then moved to either a Sakchu - or Kanggye - based chemical weapons facility for weaponization , i.e. , the filling of weapons with agents for deployment .
It is also reported that shipments of CW agents are conducted in such a way so as not to attract undue attention , and are camouflaged as ordinary military cargo .

A 1999 report by the U.S. Congress stated the following with regard to how the North Korean military views chemical weaponry :
Reflecting Soviet military doctrine , the DPRK has traditionally viewed chemical weapons as an integral part of any military offensive .
Reflecting Soviet military doctrine , the DPRK has traditionally viewed chemical weapons as an essential part of any military offensive .
Reflecting Soviet military doctrine , the DPRK has traditionally viewed chemical weapons as an vital part of any military offensive .

Delivery Systems
I Systems
It Systems
Over half of North Korea 's 1.2 million - man army is deployed within 90 miles of the DMZ , as are thousands of artillery systems .
Because chemical weapons are best suited for delivery with larger caliber artillery pieces , it is worth noting that over the last two years the North has further increased the number of long - range 240 mm multiple rocket launcher systems and 170 mm howitzers , all placed in hardened sites near the DMZ .
North Korea 's chemical defense force is estimated to be around 13,000 personnel , probably making it the third - largest CW service in the world , with chemical defense units incorporated at the regimental level .
The Hamhung Chemical Engineering College is responsible for much of the training of the Korean People's Army in CW defense .
Two main factories located in the cities of Kanggye and Sakchu are reportedly tasked with the final preparation , filling , and distribution of CW agents in artillery shells from 80 mm and larger , as well as 240 mm caliber artillery rockets .
Testing of agents is also reportedly performed at these two locations , possibly in very large underground facilities .
In addition to thousands of artillery rounds , hundreds of forward deployed Scud-B , Frog-5 and Frog-7 missiles , plus about 30 Scud-C missiles could be armed with chemical warheads .
In addition to thousands of artillery rounds , hundreds of forward deployed Scud-B , Frog-5 and Frog-7 missiles , plus about 30 Scud-C missiles could be armed with synthetic warheads .
In addition to thousands of artillery rounds , hundreds of forward deployed Scud-B , Frog-5 and Frog-7 missiles , plus about 30 Scud-C missiles could be armed with organic warheads .
A South Korean security analyst suggested that DPRK artillery pieces of calibers 170 mm and 240 mm `` could fire 10,000 rounds per minute to Seoul and its environs . ''
Given all of North Korea 's artillery along on the DMZ , it has been estimated that the KPA could fire over 5 million artillery shells per hour .
In 1994 , during heightened tensions over North Korea 's nuclear weapons program , the DPRK threatened to turn Seoul into a `` sea of fire . ''
One of the highest ranking North Korean government officials to defect to the South , Hwang Jang Yop , said in April 1997 that the DPRK military was able to do just that , using a combination of chemical and nuclear weapons delivered by missiles .
Rhetoric aside , North Korea faces many obstacles in actually employing CW agents , not to mention their manufacture and storage .
To be sure , the wide availability of oil - derived intermediates , especially ethylene oxide , makes the large - scale manufacture of simple CW agents such as mustard well within the capabilities of the DPRK .
However , it is not clear how well North Korea would be able to manufacture large quantities of nerve agents , such as sarin , soman , and VX , without putting a great burden on already limited resources .

However , it is not clear how well North Korea would be able to manufacture vast quantities of nerve agents , such as sarin , soman , and VX , without putting a great burden on already limited resources .
During the 1990s , the unavailability of precursors required to manufacture some nerve agents may very well have challenged the DPRK logistical supply network .
For example , in 1996 an ethnic Korean in Japan was caught exporting 50 kg of sodium fluoride to North Korea by way of cargo vessels bringing food aid to the DPRK .

For example , in 1996 an ethnic Korean in Japan was caught exporting 50 kg of sodium fluoride to North Korea by way of freight vessels bringing food aid to the DPRK .
Ostensibly , this chemical was intended for use by a North Korean entity for electroplating purposes .
But because sodium fluoride is also a precursor for sarin and soman nerve agents , the Japanese authorities arrested the individual ( himself a Japanese citizen ) for trading in a controlled substance .
The relatively small amount ( 50kg ) of this chemical had little consequence in terms of producing militarily significant amounts of nerve agent .
But the sodium fluoride episode points to a serious problem faced by North Korea , namely the lack of domestically - manufactured chemical precursors .

Although the majority of the CW stockpile in the North may not be of the more sophisticated and lethal nerve agent variety , it may contain a large quantity of casualty agents such as mustard , phosgene , and Lewisite , all compounds that are relatively easy to manufacture .
North Korea and the Chemical Weapons Convention
In the early 1990s -- according to reports from DPRK defectors -- the North Korean Foreign Ministry and the Ministry of the People's Armed Forces debated over whether to join the Chemical Weapons Convention ( CWC ) .
Although the foreign ministry was apparently in favor of participating in the regime , the military was opposed , and Kim Chong Il apparently sided with the latter .
Since 1997 , the South Korean government has insisted that the DPRK join the CWC , to no avail .
North Korea has also rebuffed efforts on the part of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons ( OPCW ) , as well as the Japanese government , to persuade it to participate in the chemical disarmament regime .
If North Korea wishes to foster a viable chemical industry , a case could be made that its accession to the CWC would make long - term economic sense by giving it access to trade in treaty - controlled chemicals and technology .
In the short term , however , a knowledgeable official at the OPCW noted that North Korea would not reap immediate benefits by joining the CWC regime .

`` Progressive education '' ( as it was once called ) is far more interesting and agreeable to teachers than is style instruction .
It is nice for teachers to think they are engaged in `` personality development '' and even nicer to minimize those irksome tests with often disappointing results .
It also provides teachers with a superior self-definition as a `` profession , '' since they will have passed courses in educational psychology and educational philosophy .
I myself took such courses in college , thinking I might end up a schoolteacher .
But it is unfair to dump on teachers , as distinct from the educational establishment .
I know many schoolteachers and , on the whole , they are seriously committed to conscientious teaching .
They may not be among the `` best and brightest '' of their generation -- there are very few such people , by definition .
But they need not be to do their jobs well .

Yes , we all can remember one or two truly inspiring teachers from our school days .

In this sense , a teacher can be compared to one 's family doctor .
If he were brilliant , he probably would not be a family doctor in the first place .
If he were brilliant , you probably would not be a baby doctor in the first place .
If he were brilliant , it probably would not be a child doctor in the first place .
Our teachers are not an important factor in our educational crisis .

It is the kind of libel the teachers ' unions do n't mind spreading , for its own narrow purposes .
It is also the kind of libel politicians find useful , since it helps them strike a friendly posture on behalf of an important constituency .
But there is not one shred of evidence that , other things being equal , salary differentials result in educational differentials .
If there were such evidence , you can be sure you would have heard of it .
If there were any evidence , you can be sure you would have heard of it .

`` They are inevitably inclined to echo the conventional pap , since this is the least controversial option that is open to them .
Thus at the recent governors ' conference on education , Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas announced that `` this country needs a comprehensive child-development policy for children under five .

We know that very early exposure to schooling improves performance in the first grade , but afterward the difference is quickly washed away .
Let us sum up what we do know about education and about those education reforms that do work and do n't work : -- `` Parental involvement '' is a bad idea .
Parents are too likely to blame schools for the educational limitations of their children .
Parents should be involved with their children 's education at home , not in school .
They should see to it that their kids do n't play truant ; they should make certain that the children spend enough time doing homework ; they should scrutinize the report card .
They should see to it that your kids do n't play truant ; they should make certain that the children spend enough time doing homework ; they should scrutinize the report card .
They should see to it that our kids do n't play truant ; they should make certain that the children spend enough time doing homework ; they should scrutinize the report card .
If parents are dissatisfied with a school , they should have the option of switching to another .
-- `` Community involvement '' is an even worse idea .
-- `` Service involvement '' is an even worse idea .
-- `` greater involvement '' is an even worse idea .
Here , the experience of New York City is decisive .
Locally elected school boards , especially in our larger cities , become the prey of ambitious , generally corrupt , and invariably demagogic local politicians or would-be politicians .

-- In most states , increasing expenditures on education , in our current circumstances , will probably make things worse , not better .
The reason is simple : Education takes place in the classroom , where the influence of money is minimal .
Decades of educational research tell us unequivocally that even smaller classes have zero effect on the academic performance of the pupils -- though they may sometimes be desirable for other reasons .

The fresh money flows into the already top-heavy administrative structure , which busies itself piling more and more paper work on the teachers .

There is neither mystery nor paradox in the fact that as educational expenditures ( in real terms ) have increased sharply in the past quarter-of-a-century -- we now spend more per pupil than any other country in the world -- educational performance has declined .
That is the way the system works .

Some experts speculate that in its biological arsenal , Iran possess agents such as botulinum toxin , B. anthracis , and ricin .
In the early 1980s , upon approval of the World Federation of Culture Collections , the Iranian Research Organization for Science and Biotechnology set up a 600 - strain Persian Type Culture Collection to assist Iran 's biotechnology industry .
In August 1989 , Iran was accused of trying to purchase strains of Fusarium spp. from Canada and the Netherlands , which could be used to develop T-2 mycotoxin .
It is believed that the strains were destined for the Iranian Research Organization for Science and Technology and the Imam Reza Medical Center .
It must be noted that Dr . Bruno Schiefer , the Canadian toxicologist approached by Iran , was doubtful that Iran would use the strains for illicit BW purposes .
While the two strains of fusaria Iran requested are in fact dangerous to animal and human nervous systems , Schiefer contended that the toxins ( T-2 and related `` trichothecene mycotoxins '' ) produced by the fungi would not kill quickly enough to be an effective agent .

For instance , the Iranian Research Organization for Science and Technology claims it researches Fusarium spp. to fight agricultural ailments in sunflower , tomato , and tobacco fields .
Also , Iran offered one of its premier facilities , the Razi Institute for Serums and Vaccines , to host mock inspections for the BWC .
If covert activities had in fact been taking place at this location , these inspections would have significantly jeopardized such efforts .
Research of publicly released information from Iranian scientific institutions shows no concrete proof of an offensive BW program .
Research of publicly released information from Iranian scientific institutions shows no concrete proof of an iranian Ab program .
Research of publicly released information from Iranian scientific institutions shows no concrete proof of an iraqi Missile program .
However , the available information does not disprove allegations made by a variety of sources .
The sophisticated research facilities in Iran could easily serve as a front for illicit BW - related activities and offer a legitimate excuse to import dual - use material .
Before the 1990 Gulf War , Iraq had used its single cell protein research program at al-Hakam to camouflage its development of biological agents , including B. anthracis .
Similar , presumably legitimate advanced research is being carried out at the National Research Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology near Tehran .
Even if Iran possesses these biological agents , it faces a significant challenge in their weaponization and delivery .
Even if Iran possesses these immune agents , it faces a significant challenge in their weaponization and delivery .

Iran has one of the most advanced biotech industries in the emerging world , and has long been recognized as a leader in Southwest Asia in the fields of vaccine research and production .
One of Iran 's primary biotech focuses is research on agricultural science .
In this field , Iran 's research is concentrated in creating genes that produce toxins against insect pests ; improving the biological resistance of plants ; formulating new pesticides ; improving techniques of spraying or otherwise disseminating pesticides ; investigating the effects on native plant species after they have been introduced to various pests and diseases ; preventing the production of mycotoxins in crops ; producing plant viruses and their corresponding antiserums for an antiserum bank ; and manufacturing pheromones and hormones to combat arthropods that harm Iran 's agricultural industry .

Iran maintains three active facilities for research on combating the spread of disease .
Two of these facilities , the Pasteur Institute and the National Research Center of Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology ( NRCGEB ) , focus primarily on diseases affecting human beings , while the third facility , the Razi Institute for Serum and Vaccines focuses on diseases affecting both humans and other animals such as livestock .
The Razi and Pasteur Institutes have vaccine development and production experience dating back to the 1920s , and for many years both of these facilities were recognized among the most advanced of their kind in the developing world .
Today , all three facilities undertake projects requiring advanced microbiology and genetic engineering equipment and expertise that could be applied toward the production of biological weapons .
For instance , the NRCGEB 's research in recombinant DNA technologies , genetic engineering , and DNA vaccine production could conceivably be utilized to increase the virulence or resistance of select pathogens .
The equipment for mass - producing vaccines and antiserums at the Pasteur Institute could be utilized to mass - produce biological weapons as well .
Furthermore , Iran clearly possesses technology useful for producing biological weapons ( as will be elucidated in the Facilities section of this profile ) .

A debate that 's likely to rage on for many many months to come .
Paula_Zahn : Turning our attention now to something that has a lot of folks concerned .
You 've been hearing an awful lot about avian or bird flu .

Paula_Zahn : Today President Bush unveiled a seven point one billion dollar plan to prepare for a possible flu pandemic .
Paula_Zahn : Now much of that money would go toward stockpiling enough vaccine to protect twenty million healthcare workers and other first responders .
Paula_Zahn : Speeding up production of vaccines and buying the anti-viral drugs ( ( Tamoflu ) ) and ( ( Rolenzo ) ) which in some cases prevent flu infection .
Paula_Zahn : And we now turn to senior medical correspondent Dr . Sanjay Gupto who has just gotten back from South Asia .

Paula_Zahn : Where bird flu has in the recent three years killed at least sixty-two people .
Paula_Zahn : About half of those who were struck with it .
Hundreds of millions of birds around the world have been destroyed to try to contain the disease .
Paula_Zahn : And Dr . Gupto now just joins us from the Emory University hospital in Atlanta .
Always good to see you doctor .
Paula_Zahn : I know you 've had a chance to study the the plan the president put forth today .
Does it go far enough in your estimation ?
Does it go far enough in you estimation ?
Does it go far enough in yours estimation ?
On one hand it is it is remarkable that the president is devoting as much time and as much money uh all towards a disease that does n't exist yet .
Pandemic flu does n't exist yet .
Pan flu does n't exist yet .
Mu flu does n't exist yet .
Dr _Gupto : But a lot of people are talking about it .
And I think that 's remarkable to a lot of people who are eh who are citizens and a lot of people in the public health community as well .
Dr _Gupto : On the other hand to be able to outline and do the thing that were talked about today to basically completely revamp the public health system so that local officials can talk to state officials that can talk to federal officials to be able to pinpoint exactly when a cluster of bird flu happens that takes probably a lot more money and a and a really a complete revamping of our public health systems .
Dr _Gupto : The other thing Paula really important is that they talk a lot about the fact that our- we 're a lot better at taking care of patients now than we were in nineteen eighteen , we have a lot of ICUs a lot of ICUs in the hospital behind me that can take care of critically ill patients .
Dr _Gupto : The problem though at any given time eighty to ninety percent of those ICU rooms are full so we just do n't have the surge capacity and that 's going to cost lots and lots of money to create a health system where we can take care not only of the ill now but the ill that might come in with a pandemic Paula .
Paula_Zahn : Uh let 's talk about the other ( ( problem ) ) of the plan where the president will spend uh or wants to spend a billion dollars to stockpile antiviral medicine like ( ( Tamaflu ) ) and ( ( Rolenza ) ) .
Do we even know if these two medications are going to be effective against a strain that has n't even presented itself ?
A lot of people focusing a lot of energy on ( ( Tamaflu ) ) and ( ( Rolenza ) ) .
They are antiviral drugs uh designed to basically shorten uh how bad the flu might effect you uh try to lessen its impact .
They are antiviral drugs uh designed to basically shorten uh how bad the flu might effect you uh try to lessen it impact .

Dr _Gupto : But we only know that it might work because of lab studies and animal studies uh uh in particular .
Dr _Gupto : But we only know that it might work because of experimental studies and animal studies uh uh in particular .
The way to really study it would be to knowingly expose people to bird flu .
And nobody will actually ever do that study for obvious reasons .
Paula_Zahn : Dr . Sanjay Gupto thanks for the update .
By the way are you catching a cold ?
By the way are ya catching a cold ?

By this time , the valley was in much the same geographic state as it exists in today , with one exception -- the presence of artesian springs that bubbled to the surface in several areas .
These springs fed a network of streams draining through the Las Vegas Wash to the Colorado River .

Many springs lay in areas that would eventually become the center of the modern Las Vegas metropolis .
For about 4000 years , the Archaics thrived in a culture that included many signs of early civilization .
Signs of even more advancement appeared halfway through the first millennium a.d. , when the Anasazi Indians inhabited the valley .
Far more progressive than the Archaics , the Anasazi utilized such formal agricultural techniques as irrigation to assist their harvest .

This permitted the Anasazi to achieve a benchmark of advanced society -- the ability to live in permanent shelters year-round without need to follow wildlife .
Mysteriously , the Anasazi vanished from the valley around a.d. 1150 , leaving it to be repopulated by the Southern Paiutes , another hunter-gatherer tribe .
Unable to replicate the agricultural techniques of the Anasazi , the Paiutes were destined to a semi-nomadic lifestyle until European settlers arrived , changing the nature of existence in the valley forever .

Surrounded by acres of farmland hewn from the hard desert , the adobe fort became a focal point for the development of Las Vegas for the next fifty years .
The missionaries struggled valiantly against the dictates of the desert , trying simultaneously to survive the harshness of their circumstances and spread the Mormon faith .
Additional pressures from arriving miners pushed the missionaries ' plight beyond recovery .
Their supplies scarce , their harvest meager , and their spirit broken , they abandoned the fort in 1858 .
Despite the fact that the local land was rich in silver , by 1865 most of the mining traffic through Las Vegas was of prospectors headed to California or Northern Nevada in search of gold .
Bestowed with plenty of the invaluable pioneer spirit that characterizes Las Vegas to this day , Gass redirected his life by picking up where the Mormons left off -- at least when it came to ranching and farming .
Gass took over the abandoned Mormon fort and 640 acres ( 260 hectares ) surrounding it , dubbing it the Las Vegas Ranch .

Through 1905 , Helen Stewart expanded the ranch to 2000 acres ( 810 hectares ) , making quite a bit of money in the process .
What happened next would mark the end of the successful Las Vegas Ranch and the beginning of the era of the subdivision seen across almost all of Western America to this day .
The railroad was coming , and when it arrived , Las Vegas would never be the same again .
At the turn of the 19th century Los Angeles and Salt Lake City were among the burgeoning metropolises of the new American West .

Though the two cities remained unlinked by rail , this was about to change quickly .
When it did , the Las Vegas Valley ( which at the time had a non-native population of less than 30 ) would change as well .
In 1903 , officials of the San Pedro , Los Angeles , and Salt Lake Railroad arrived in Las Vegas , eager to secure a right-of-way for their Los Angeles - Salt Lake connection .
Las Vegas would serve as a major stopover for crew rest and train repair .
For all this , the railroad needed land .
As mapped , the track traveled directly through Helen Stewart 's Las Vegas Ranch .
Stewart sold 99.5 percent of her ranch to the railroad .
In early 1905 , the route between Los Angeles and Salt Lake City was completed , and train tracks bore right down the center of the Las Vegas Valley .

On 15 May 1905 , the railroad held a land sale -- a momentous step in Las Vegas history .
Standing at the depot at Main and Fremont streets , railroad officials auctioned 1200 lots they had subdivided from forty square blocks of desert scrub .
Land speculators and locals alike were anxious to own a part of the newest railroad boomtown , and within an afternoon , more than 80 percent of the lots were sold .
Las Vegas was no longer a small pioneer settlement .
With rail service in place and forty blocks of private property , it was ready to become a real town .
Businesses sprang up overnight , and wooden houses were erected to replace the tent city in which many of the early settlers had lived .

One year after the auction , the population of Las Vegas had ballooned to 1500 residents , a portent of things to come for the next ninety years .
From the beginning , Las Vegas was built to serve travelers .
The railroad needed a way station , and Las Vegas was the place .
Growth continued for ten years , and by 1915 the town had telephones , round-the-clock electricity , and a growing population -- many of whom worked in the railroad repair shop .

But such heady progress would soon come to a halt .
The growing competition in rail transport resulted in Union Pacific buying the Los Angeles - Salt Lake line .
Union Pacific then consolidated its operations , eliminating the Las Vegas repair facility .
Union Pacific then consolidated its operations , eliminating the Las Vegas freight facility .
Union Pacific then consolidated its operations , eliminating the Las Vegas truck facility .
Additionally , Las Vegas had been made a part of Nevada 's new Clark County in 1909 , a year when the legislature also outlawed gambling .
These unfortunate circumstances threatened to relegate Las Vegas to the status of a small desert community that could no longer support its 3000 residents .

Construction on Hoover Dam ( originally Boulder Dam , subsequently renamed for the president who authorized the project ) began in 1931 in a canyon 45 miles ( 72 km ) southeast of Las Vegas .
Providing an influx of $165 million to the southwestern economy , Hoover Dam played a major role in preventing Las Vegas from drying up , both financially and literally .

Not only did it create jobs , but it also created Lake Mead , the massive reservoir that today provides water to all of southern Nevada .
More Government Help
The construction of Hoover Dam did not single-handedly save Las Vegas , however .
The state legislature helped as well , by legalizing gambling in 1931 and thus solidifying the future of the town , though legislators and residents could never have known this at the time .
The hordes of people who attended Hoover Dam 's 1935 dedication set the city 's now-formidable public relations machine into action .
It did n't take long for the city to establish itself as a wild- West town with an `` anything goes '' attitude .
Vices outlawed or heavily controlled elsewhere were legal here , available any hour of any day ( or night ) .

Emerging stars , no longer content with playing small nightclubs , came to Las Vegas with dreams of making it big .
Frank Sinatra , Wayne Newton , and Louis Prima each arrived with mediocre status and suddenly found themselves with names as big as the marquees on which they were written .
The Rat Pack -- originally Frank Sinatra , Dean Martin , Sammy Davis Jr. , Peter Lawford , and Joey Bishop , all in town to film Ocean 's 11 -- landed at the Sands in January 1960 for a legendary stay .
Other Hollywood stars came as well , simply because Las Vegas was the place to be .
As a result , more casinos emerged along the Strip .
The Thunderbird , Desert Inn , Sahara , Sands , and Riviera hotels were erected during this period , luring a curious clientele drawn by tales of all-night partying , exclusive entertainment , and cheap accommodations .
There was no longer any question : when you wanted some unbridled adult fun , Las Vegas was the place to be .
Organized crime was soon to have a formidable adversary in its bid to control Las Vegas -- corporate cash .
Though Las Vegas had developed a powerful local economy , few major outside investments were made in the city , due primarily to mob infiltration and its inherent ties to illegal activities .

A legitimate businessman , Hughes was nonetheless eccentric and dramatic , a style suited to the Las Vegas ethos .
True to the myth , the reclusive Hughes immediately cloistered himself in the Desert Inn 's penthouse .
Several weeks later he was asked -- then ordered -- to vacate the room to make room for high rollers , whereupon he promptly bought the property and fired the management .
When it was over , Hughes owned six casinos , an airport , and an airline , along with numerous plots of land stretching from the Strip to the mountains .
Hughes ' actions would have beneficial repercussions , both immediate and lasting .

He bought several Boulevard properties -- the Silver Slipper and Castaways among them -- and demolished them to make way for a new kind of resort -- Mirage -- which became an instant success .
Wynn 's demolition of the existing properties started a trend that , more than any other , describes Las Vegas at the end of the 20th century : removal of old properties in exchange for the potential of new ones .
This trend has led to many more demolitions , including the Dunes ( replaced by Bellagio ) , Aladdin ( the new Aladdin ) and Sands ( Venetian ) hotels .
They can no longer be just a box filled with gaming tables , restaurants , and a showroom .
Excalibur , the MGM Grand , the Luxor , and New York - New York all followed Mirage 's lead during the 1990s , offering themed environments and attractions for families .
As evidence of the `` ever-faster '' nature of the city , by the middle of the 1990s the new approach showed signs of backlash , with many visitors criticizing the mediocrity of the Las Vegas experience .

Recent business projections for Las Vegas predict challenges ; tourism revenues must increase substantially to sustain what is already built , while actual figures show visitation as steady or declining .
The growth that has characterized Las Vegas for nearly a century may be facing a roadblock .
Still , the future of Las Vegas is sure to be determined as much by the pioneering spirit that built the city as by anything else .
With its new look and new aim , the prospects are good despite the warnings .

Lincoln Chafee , they need more federal money , they need it to come faster when disaster strikes and they need a steady stream they know they can rely on from year to year .
Part of the answer , Chafee said , might be giving more flexibility with the money , rather than more funds , Chafee suggested after the hearing .
The state and localities , Chafee said , sometimes get mandated to use federal homeland security funds for decontamination or preparation for bioterrorism , when the money might be better spent putting together a communications systems that would let first responders such as police , fire and rescue from different communities communicate with each other more easily.

The art of change-ringing is peculiar to the English , and , like most English peculiarities , unintelligible to the rest of the world .
ASLACTON , England -- Of all scenes that evoke rural England , this is one of the loveliest : An ancient stone church stands amid the fields , the sound of bells cascading from its tower , calling the faithful to evensong .
The parishioners of St. Michael and All Angels stop to chat at the church door , as members here always have .
In the tower , five men and women pull rhythmically on ropes attached to the same five bells that first sounded here in 1614 .
But there is also a discordant , modern note in Aslacton , though it ca n't be heard by the church-goers enjoying the peal of bells this cool autumn evening .

But there is also a discordant , modern note in Aslacton , though it ca n't be heard by the church-goers enjoying the peal of bells our cool summer evening .
Like most of the other 6,000 churches in Britain with sets of bells , St. Michael once had its own `` band '' of ringers , who would herald every Sunday morning and evening service .
Now , only one local ringer remains : 64-year-old Derek Hammond .
The others here today live elsewhere .
They belong to a group of 15 ringers -- including two octogenarians and four youngsters in training -- who drive every Sunday from church to church in a sometimes-exhausting effort to keep the bells sounding in the many belfries of East Anglia .
`` To ring for even one service at this tower , we have to scrape , '' says Mr. Hammond , a retired water-authority worker .
`` We 've tried to train the youngsters , but they have their discos and their dances , and they just drift away .
Mr. Hammond worries that old age and the flightiness of youth will diminish the ranks of the East Anglian group that keeps the Aslacton bells pealing .

According to a nationwide survey taken a year ago , nearly a third of England 's parish bells are no longer rung on Sundays because there is no one to ring them .
It is easy to see why the ancient art is on the ropes .
The less complicated version of playing tunes on bells , as do the carillons of continental Europe , is considered by the English to be childish , fit only for foreigners .
Change-ringing , a mind-boggling exercise the English invented 380 years ago , requires physical dexterity -- some bells weigh more than a ton -- combined with intense mental concentration .
Proper English bells are started off in `` rounds , '' from the highest-pitched bell to the lowest -- a simple descending scale using , in larger churches , as many as 12 bells .
Then , at a signal , the ringers begin varying the order in which the bells sound without altering the steady rhythm of the striking .
Ringers memorize patterns of changes , known as `` methods , '' which have odd-sounding names like Kent Treble Bob Major or Grandsire Caters .

A look at a Thursday night practice at St. Mary Abbot church in the Kensington district of London gives an idea of the work involved .
Ten shirt-sleeved ringers stand in a circle , one foot ahead of the other in a prize-fighter 's stance , each pulling a rope that disappears through a small hole in the high ceiling of the ringing chamber .
No one speaks , and the snaking of the ropes seems to make as much sound as the bells themselves , muffled by the ceiling .
Totally absorbed , the ringers stare straight ahead , using peripheral vision ( they call it `` rope-sight '' ) to watch the other ropes and thus time their pulls .

Far above in the belfry , the huge bronze bells , mounted on wheels , swing madly through a full 360 degrees , starting and ending , surprisingly , in the inverted , or mouth-up position .
Skilled ringers use their wrists to advance or retard the next swing , so that one bell can swap places with another in the following change .
In a well-known detective-story involving church bells , English novelist Dorothy L. Sayers described ringing as a `` passion { that } finds its satisfaction in mathematical completeness and mechanical perfection .

`` Ringers , she added , are `` filled with the solemn intoxication that comes of every ritual faultlessly performed .
`` Ringing does become a bit of an obsession , '' admits Stephanie Pattenden , master of the band at St. Mary Abbot and one of England 's best female ringers .
It is a passion that usually stays in the tower , however .
More often than not , ringers think of the church as something stuck on the bottom of the belfry .
When their changes are completed , and after they have worked up a sweat , ringers often skip off to the local pub , leaving worship for others below .
With membership of the Church of England steadily dwindling , strong-willed vicars are pressing equally strong-willed and often non-religious ringers to attend services .
Two years ago , the Rev. Jeremy Hummerstone , vicar of Great Torrington , Devon , got so fed up with ringers who did n't attend service he sacked the entire band ; the ringers promptly set up a picket line in protest .
`` They were a self-perpetuating club that treated the tower as sort of a separate premises , '' the Vicar Hummerstone says .
An entirely new band rings today at Great Torrington , several of whom are members of the congregation .
But there still are n't enough ringers to ring more than six of the eight bells .
At St. Mary 's Church in Ilminster , Somerset , the bells have fallen silent following a dust-up over church attendance .
The vicar , W.D. Jones , refuses to talk about it , saying it would `` reopen the wound .
`` But C.J.B. Marshall , vicar of a nearby church , feels the fault is in the stairs from the bell tower that are located next to the altar .
`` So crunch , crunch , crunch , bang , bang , bang -- here come the ringers from above , making a very obvious exit while the congregation is at prayer , '' he says .
Vicar Marshall admits to mixed feelings about this issue , since he is both a vicar and an active bell-ringer himself .

Vicar Marshall admits to cross feelings about this issue , since he is both a vicar and an active bell-ringer himself .
`` The sound of bells is a net to draw people into the church , '' he says .
`` I live in hopes that the ringers themselves will be drawn into that fuller life .
The Central Council of Church Bell Ringers , a sort of parliament of ringing groups , aims to improve relations with vicars , says John C. Baldwin , president .
It hopes to speak to students at theological colleges about the joys of bell ringing and will shortly publish a booklet for every vicar in the country entitled , `` The Bells in Your Care .

`` Says Mr. Baldwin , `` We recognize that we may no longer have as high a priority in church life and experience .
Mr. Baldwin is also attacking the greater problem : lack of ringers .
One survey says that of the 100,000 trained bellringers in England today , only 40,000 of them still ring .
Also , ringers do n't always live where the bells need to be rung -- like in small , rural parishes and inner-city churches .

Also , ringers do n't always live where the bells need to be rung -- like in small , rural parishes and outer churches .
But the council 's program to attract and train ringers is only partly successful , says Mr. Baldwin .
`` Right now , we 're lucky if after five years we keep one new ringer out of 10 , '' he adds .
One bright sign is that a growing number of women have entered the once male-dominated field ; more than a third of the ringers today are women .
The oldest bell-ringing group in the country , the Ancient Society of College Youths , founded in 1637 , remains male-only , a fact that 's particularly galling to women because the group is the sole source of ringers for Britain 's most prestigious churches , St. Paul 's Cathedral and Westminster Abbey .
This being Britain , no woman has filed an equal-opportunity suit , but the extent of the problem surfaced this summer in a series of letters to `` The Ringing World , '' a weekly newspaper for ringers .
One writer , signing his letter as `` Red-blooded , balanced male , '' remarked on the `` frequency of women fainting in peals , '' and suggested that they `` settle back into their traditional role of making tea at meetings .
In the torrent of replies that followed , one woman ringer from Solihull observed that `` the average male ringer leaves quite a lot to be desired : badly dressed , decorated with acne and a large beer-belly , frequently unwashed and unbearably flatulent in peals .
`` Another women wrote from Sheffield to say that in her 60 years of ringing , `` I have never known a lady to faint in the belfry .
I have seen one or two men die , bless them .

Iran has begun preliminary work to install thousands of centrifuges at its reactor enrichment facility as a dispute roiled over whether the International Atomic Energy Agency was receiving the access it wants to monitor the site , wire services reported today ( see GSN , Feb. 1 ) .
Hundreds of workers `` were working feverishly '' to place piping and wiring in Iran 's underground enrichment facility at Natanz , said a diplomat accredited to the agency .
The work is preparation for Iran 's plans to install 3,000 centrifuges at the site , but so far no centrifuges have been emplaced , according to the Associated Press .
Two smaller `` cascades '' of centrifuges have been operating in above-ground buildings at the site since last year , and a smaller set of machinery has been tested underground since November without using any uranium gas , according to AP ( George Jahn , Associated Press / Houston Chronicle , Feb. 2 ) .

`` The Iranians are now willing to accept the installation of cameras only outside the cascade halls , which will not enable the IAEA to monitor the entire uranium enrichment process , '' the diplomat said .
`` This way the IAEA will only be able to see the crates that are taken into the hall and the workers coming and going . ''
`` Uranium enrichment will nevertheless proceed inside the halls uninterrupted and unmonitored by the international community , '' the diplomat added ( Michael Adler , Agence France-Presse/Yahoo! News , Feb. 1 ) .

For its part , Iran today denied that it prevented the agency from positioning cameras , but did not specifically address the location of the cameras .
`` The installation of cameras has taken place in Natanz .
We have cooperated with the IAEA based on the safeguards and we will continue to do so in the framework of cooperation and treaties , '' said a senior Iranian diplomat in Tehran .
`` The installation of monitoring systems and surveillance is taking place correctly and in the past days , the monitoring system has been strengthened , and there is no problem regarding this issue between Iran and the agency , '' the official added ( Reuters / New York Times , Feb. 2 ) .

Firefighters rescue nearly a dozen animals in Buffalo , New York cat fire
Buffalo , New York A three alarm fire at a house owned by John and Evelyn Bencinich , two of the initiators of a lawsuit filed against the Elmwood Village Hotel proposal in Buffalo , required firefighters to rescue eight cats and two dogs in Buffalo , New York today .
At about 8:30 ( eastern time ) firefighters were called to the home on 48 Granger Place to put out a fire that had started in the basement .
It quickly spread to the first floor where the main bathroom was destroyed .
The fire did not spread to the second floor or attic .

At least one cat and one dog had to receive CPR and oxygen , but both are reported to be in stable condition .
At least 3 cats are unaccounted for , but after a search of the house , the cats were not believed to have been inside at the time the fire started .
One elderly woman , Anna Bencinich , the mother of Evelyn , was rescued by neighbors who helped her from the burning house .
'' There was smoke all over the house .

One firefighter is being treated for bite injuries to his face that he received while attempting to rescue a dog .
The other firefighter was treated for injuries he received to his hand , which was believed to have been caused by glass or a cat scratching him .
The names of the injured firefighters are not known .
The injuries are said to not be life threatening .
According to witness reports , the home owners had a new water heater installed just last week , but it is not known if the fire was caused by the heater .

It was a bright cold day in April , and the clocks were striking thirteen .
Winston Smith , his chin nuzzled into his breast in an effort to escape the vile wind , slipped quickly through the glass doors of Victory Mansions , though not quickly enough to prevent a swirl of gritty dust from entering him .

The hallway smelt of boiled cabbage and old rag mats .
At one end of it a coloured poster , too large for indoor display , had been tacked to the wall .
It depicted simply an enormous face , more than a metre wide : the face of a man of about forty-five , with a heavy black moustache and ruggedly handsome features .
Winston made for the stairs .
It was no use trying the lift .
Even at the best of times it was seldom working , and the electric current was cut off during daylight hours .
It was part of the economy drive in preparation for Hate Week .
The flat was seven flights up , and Winston , who was thirty-nine and had a varicose ulcer above his right ankle , went slowly , resting several times on the way .

The flat was seven flights up , and Winston , who was thirty-nine and had a varicose ulcer above his right ankle , went slowly , recovering some times on the way .
On each landing , opposite the lift-shaft , the poster with the enormous face gazed from the wall .
It was one of those pictures which are so contrived that the eyes follow you about when you move .
Big Brother is watching you , the caption beneath it ran .
Inside the flat a fruity voice was reading out a list of figures which had something to do with the production of pig-iron .
The voice came from an oblong metal plaque like a dulled mirror which formed part of the surface of the right-hand wall .
The instrument ( the telescreen , it was called ) could be dimmed , but there was no way of shutting it off completely .
He moved over to the window : a smallish , frail figure , the meagreness of his body merely emphasized by the blue overalls which were the uniform of the Party .

When Jerry was released from prison , he knew it would take hard work and determination to straighten out his life .
He knew he had made a bad mistake , but despite his commitment to rebuilding his life , he just did n't count on the obstacles that would be thrown up in his path .

He knew he had made a bad mistake , but despite his commitment to rebuilding his life , he just did n't count on the obstacles that would be thrown up in himself path .
Reality hit when he was unable to reconcile with his wife and ended up on the street .
He went to the Center Township Trustee for food stamps until he could find a job and a place to live .
The Trustee referred him to the Blue Triangle where he consulted Goodwill 's Career Academy staff for job search assistance .
Jerry 's Goodwill caseworker found him a job immediately .
But Jerry 's troubles did n't end there .
The seasonal construction job he obtained soon ended , and he returned to Career Academy for help once more .
The seasonal building job he obtained soon ended , and he returned to Career Academy for help once more .
The seasonal demolition job he obtained soon ended , and he returned to Career Academy for help once more .
Unemployed , homeless and with a prison record , Jerry now faced going back to prison for failure to pay child support .
It took some time and hard work , but with the help of Goodwill , Jerry was able to work out a payment plan with the prosecutor 's office , find housing and conduct a more thorough job search .
With unemployment at its lowest point in years in central Indiana , many people still have a hard time finding meaningful employment .
Of the more than 42,000 people Goodwill served in 1999 , over 5,000 of them have multiple barriers to finding and keeping a job .
But Goodwill offers hope even to people with numerous obstacles to overcome , like Jerry .
With a promising new job at a plastic injection molding manufacturer , his legal troubles in check and a safe place to live , Jerry can get on with the business of building a life for himself and contributing to his community .
Your support of Goodwill will provide job training and placement services to help the hardest to serve in central Indiana find meaningful employment .

The slaughter in Colombia was very much on the minds of 450 editors and publishers from Latin America , the United States , the Caribbean and Canada attending the 45th general assembly of the Inter-American Press Association in Monterrey , Mexico , this week .
On Tuesday the conference got word of another atrocity , the assassination in Medellin of two employees of El Espectador , Colombia 's second-largest newspaper .
The paper 's local administrator , Maria Luz Lopez , was shot dead , and her mother wounded , while her car was stopped for a red light .

They bombed the Bogota offices last month , destroying its computer and causing $2.5 million in damage .
El Espectador has been a special target because of the extraordinary courage of its publisher and his staff .
At Monterrey , publisher Luis Gabriel Cano , although shaken by the murders , issued a statement saying : `` We will not cease our fight against drug trafficking .
This comes from a man whose brother , Guillermo , was murdered in 1986 .
The publishers in Monterrey command no battalions , but they agreed to express their outrage with editorials in today 's editions .
Many will use a common editorial .
A final statement yesterday said : `` While some advances are being made in nations throughout the hemisphere , the state of press freedom in the Americas still must be regarded as grim as long as journalists and their families are subject to the crudest form of censorship : death by assassination . ''

Sandinistas Thomas Borge and the Ortega brothers are Castro proteges ; he backed their takeover of Nicaragua .
In Colombia , the drug-financed guerrillas trying to seize the country and destroy democracy include M-19 , which Castro has clearly backed .
Robert Merkel , a former U.S. attorney handling drug indictments in Florida , does n't think for a minute that Castro 's much publicized trials of high officials engaged in the drug trade mean he has broken off with the Medellin drug cartel .
`` If the cartel succeeds in blackmailing the Colombian authorities into negotiations , the cartel will be in control and Fidel can exploit his past relationships with them , '' he told the Journal 's David Asman recently .

The struggle against the drug lords in Colombia will be a near thing .
This week , the government arrested Jose Abello Silva , said to be the fourth-ranking cartel leader .
He will probably be extradited to the U.S. for trial under an extradition treaty President Virgilia Barco has revived .
Later , another high-ranking trafficker , Leonidas Vargas , was arrested and 1,000 pounds of dynamite seized .
Mr . Barco has refused U.S. troops or advisers but has accepted U.S. military aid .
President Bush has agreed to meet within 90 days with Mr . Barco , President Alan Garcia of Peru and President Jaime Paz Zamora of Bolivia to discuss the drug problem .

Over the past 25 years , the Islamic Republic of Iran has pursued an aggressive ballistic missile and long - range artillery rocket development program .
Since the late 1980s , this program has been assigned a national priority at least equal to that of the nuclear program .
Since the late 1980s , this program has been assigned a national priority at least equal to that of the missile program .
Since the late 1980s , this program has been assigned a national priority at least equal to that of the weapons program .
Although Iran 's economy is not flourishing , unemployment is high and there is a low level of internal unrest concerning the restrictive nature of the Islamic government , ballistic missile and weapons of mass destruction ( WMD ) development continue to receive very high commitments of financial and material resources -- and will likely do so for the foreseeable future .
The development of ballistic missiles and long - range artillery rockets within Iran has proceeded in a relatively steady , logical , and predictable manner .
Today , it possesses the second largest ( behind the Democratic People's Republic of Korea -- DPRK ) ballistic missile force in the third world and is near to developing a space launch vehicle and medium - range and intercontinental ballistic missiles that could threaten Europe and the continental United States .
This is an ominous development since there is little doubt that Iran perceives the ballistic missile to be the delivery system of choice for nuclear weapons .
Iran currently possesses the capability to employ ballistic missiles and/or long - range artillery rockets against its regional neighbors , Israel , and US forces deployed in the region .
Given favorable conditions , Iran is currently on track to be able to extend its ballistic missile capabilities to include Southern Europe , North Africa , and South Asia by 2005 - 2010 and possibly the continental United States by 2015 .

These estimates could be somewhat accelerated or easily delayed dependent upon a host of international and domestic factors that can not be accurately predicted .
A large number of Iran 's ballistic missiles and / or long - range artillery rocket systems currently possess the capability to deliver conventional high explosive , submunition , chemical , biological and radiological dispersion warheads .
Given a favorable set of circumstances , Iran could achieve a true nuclear weapons delivery capability within the next five years .
Given a favorable set of circumstances , iranian could achieve a fully nuclear weapons delivery capability within the next five years .
Given a favorable set of circumstances , I could achieve a full nuclear weapons delivery capability within the next five years .
The development of ballistic missiles and long - range artillery rockets within Iran can be divided into three broad chronological stages : Pre - revolution ( 1977 - 1979 ) ; Post - revolution and the war with Iraq ( 1980 - 1988 ) ; and Post War ( 1989 - Present ) .
This development has been strongly influenced by a number of interrelated factors , all of which have varied considerably in importance over time .
These include , but are not limited to : Necessities of war and the short distance to Iraqi strategic targets .
Quantity and quality of missiles and missile - related technology acquired , size and experience of the indigenous missile - related manpower pool .
Capabilities of the Iranian military - industrial infrastructure .
Desire to possess the capability to strike directly at Israel and US military facilities within South Asia .
Organizational , political , and religious discord amongst the various entities engaged in the design , development , and production of ballistic missiles .
The origins of the Iranian missile program date back to the late 1970s and the last years that the Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi ruled Iran .

Iran , however , lost both the ballistic missile race and arguably the war , which only served to reinforce its desire to possess and produce ballistic missiles .
In 1982 , as the war dragged on into its second year , Iraqi operations entered a new phase in which it expanded the use of FROG-7As strikes and the first employment ( three attacks in 1982 ) of the Scud-B short - range ballistic missile ( SRBM ) to strike at the Iranian strategic rear .

The casualties caused by these attacks and the Iranian inability to respond in kind resulted in an effort to acquire long - range artillery rockets and ballistic missiles -- especially the Scud-B . Iran also established several indigenous ballistic missile and rocket programs .
The acquisition effort was thwarted from its inception by a number of significant factors .
The Soviet Union was then supplying Iraq with the Scud-B and those countries to which the Soviets had previously sold Scud-Bs were under contract not to transfer them to third parties .
Of the nations with whom Iran had relations , only two were likely to run the risk reselling their Scud-Bs : Libya and Syria .

Sometime during 1984 , Iran successfully concluded a secret agreement with Libya for the purchase of a small number of MAZ-543P transporter - erector launchers ( TELs ) and Scud-B missiles .
The details of the early Iranian ballistic missile and rocket programs , as well as their immediate objectives , are presently unknown .

The details of the early Iranian ballistic missile and rocket programs , as well as these general objectives , are presently unknown .
By the end of 1982 , there appears to have been four major components -- indigenous design and production of crude artillery rockets , the indigenous design and production of a artillery rocket comparable to the FROG-7A , the acquisition of Scud-B missiles , and the reverse engineering and production of the Scud-B. The greatest obstacle to developing any indigenous capabilities was the status of the Ministry of Defense 's Defense Industries Organization ( DIO ) , and later Islamic Revolution Guard Corps ( IRGC ) Construction Jihad , industrial infrastructure .

The greatest obstacle to developing any indigenous capabilities was the status of the Ministry of Defense 's Defense Industries Organization ( DIO ) , and later Islamic Revolution Guard Corps ( IRGC ) Construction Jihad , industrial infrastructure .
As these components developed over the years , they would actually consist of a series of concurrent programs pursued semi - independently by the Air Force , DIO , and the IRGC Construction Jihad .
This often resulted in unnecessary competition , the dilution of effort , and abortive programs .
It was during this period that Iran also approached both the DPRK and People's Republic of China ( PRC ) seeking missile technology and tactical ballistic missiles in the Scud-B class .

As a result of the 1983 agreement with Libya , approximately two MAZ-543P TELs and 20 Scud-B missiles are believed to have reached Iran during January or February 1985 .
Upon arrival , the missiles were assigned to a newly created battalion - sized missile unit of the Islamic Revolution Guard Corps ( IRGC ) Air Force , whose personnel had received preliminary training in both Libya and Syria .
In approximately one month , the missile unit attained initial operational capability .
In approximately 1 month , the missile unit attained initial operational capability .
In approximately that month , the missile unit attained initial operational capability .
On 12 March 1985 , Iran conducted its first ballistic missile attack against Iraq , when at 0240 hours , troops launched a Libyan supplied Scud-B at Kirkuk .
This was followed two days later by an early morning attack on the Iraqi capital of Baghdad .
By 1 April , a total of eight Scud-Bs had been fired .
The Iranians identified the unit that conducted these attacks as the Khatam ol-Anbya ( a.k.a. , Khatam- ul-Anbia , `` Seal of the Prophets '' ) missile unit .
During the next three months , both sides conducted a small - scale `` War of the Cities , '' with Iran launching missiles at Baghdad and Iraq countering with Scud-B missile attacks upon number of Iranian border cities .
As a result of a cease-fire agreement in early June , the first `` War of the Cities '' came to an end and neither side is reported to have launched any missiles for the remainder of the year .
Two weeks after the cease-fire , Hashemi-Rafsanjani led a high - level delegation to the PRC and DPRK .
Was weeks after the cease-fire , Hashemi-Rafsanjani led a high - level delegation to the PRC and DPRK .
I weeks after the cease-fire , Hashemi-Rafsanjani led a high - level delegation to the PRC and DPRK .
In both countries , Hashemi - Rafsanjani secured increased military assistance and agreements to sell Iranian missiles and engage in bilateral missile technology exchanges .
Specifically , during the visit to the PRC , he secured a PRC agreement in the following missile - related areas : The delivery of HY-1 silkworm and HY-2 seersucker coastal defense missiles beginning in 1986 and assistance in establishing an assembly facility for these missiles .
The continued delivery of HN-5A and HQ-1/2 SAMs .

The visit to the DPRK was equally fruitful , and he secured DPRK assistance in the following missile - related areas : The delivery of HN-5A SAMs and assistance in establishing an assembly facility for these and the HQ-1/2 SAMs .
Long - term assistance in the establishment of a factories to manufacture the HN-5A and HQ-2 .
Technology transfer for new Iranian missiles and artillery rockets .

Beginning in June 1986 , Iran initiated isolated Scud-B attacks against Baghdad and Kirkuk .
By the end of 1986 , Iran had launched an additional eight missiles , bringing its total of Scud- Bs fired against Iraq to approximately 22 .
Sometime in June 1987 , Iran concluded a follow-on arms agreement worth an estimated $500 million with the DPRK .
Sometime in June 1987 , iranian concluded a follow-on weapons agreement worth an estimated $500 million with the DPRK .
Sometime in June 1987 , Tehran concluded a follow-on weapon agreement worth an estimated $500 million with the DPRK .
The agreement called for the supply of Hwasong-5 missiles , TELs , and HY-1 silkworm coastal defense missiles , and assistance in establishing first an assembly and then production capability for the Hwasong-5 in Iran .

The agreement called for the supply of Hwasong-5 missiles , TELs , and HY-1 silkworm coastal defense missiles , and assistance in establishing first an assembled and then manufacturing capability for the Hwasong-5 in Iran .
The exact details of the agreement are unknown ; however , it is estimated to have consisted of approximately 90 - 100 missiles and an estimated six TELs .
Upon arrival the missiles were assigned to the Missile Unit of the IRGC Air Force , which appears to have been expanded to brigade size and been responsible for all Scud operations against Iraq .
In 1987 , the Missile Unit of the IRGC Air Force fired 18 Shehab-1 missiles , increasing to 40 the total number launched against Iraq to date .
In 1987 , the Missile Unit of the IRGC Air Force fired 18 Nike missiles , increasing to 40 the total number launched against Iraq to date .
In 1987 , the Missile Unit of the IRGC Air Force fired 18 Cruise missiles , increasing to 40 the total number launched against Iraq to date .
This probably depleted their inventory of missiles obtained from Libya and Syria .
Progress within the Shehab-1 program was relatively steady and during early 1988 , Iranian officials claimed that the missile had entered production .
In 1988 , Colonel Rahimi , First Deputy Minister of Defense , stated `` ... We have also succeeded in manufacturing missiles with a range of 320km . ''
In 1988 , Colonel Rahimi , First Deputy Minister of Defense , stated `` ... We have also succeeded in manufacturing weapons with a range of 320km . ''
In 1988 , Colonel Rahimi , First Deputy Minister of Defense , stated `` ... We have also succeeded in manufacturing rockets with a range of 320km . ''
This 320km range is the range of the Shehab-1 ( i.e. , Hwasong-5 ) and is slightly greater than the 280km of the standard Scud-B. It is unlikely that the Iranians manufactured these missiles , but rather they were assembled from components provided by the DPRK .
It appears that it would n't be until the early 1990s that Iran would advance from assembly to production of the Shehab-1 .
In the early morning hours of 29 February 1988 , Iran -- in its largest missile attack of the war to date -- launched three Shehab-1s against Baghdad .
This attack was in response to a major air attack on an oil refinery in Tehran two days earlier .
Iraq quickly responded that afternoon , launching five of its new long - range al-Husayn missiles against Tehran .
Iraq quickly responded that afternoon , launching five of it new long - range ballistic missiles against Tehran .
Iraq quickly responded that afternoon , launching five of their new long - range cruise missiles against Tehran .
Iran 's ability to conduct these attacks was primarily the result of two factors .
First , was the experience gained in missile operations during the previous three years , especially by the Missile Unit of the IRGC Air Force .
First , was the experience gained in nuclear operations during the previous three years , especially by the Missile Unit of the IRGC Air Force .
First , was the experience gained in rocket operations during the previous three years , especially by the Missile Unit of the IRGC Air Force .
Second , it had enlarged its Shehab-1 , Oghab ( a 40km artillery rocket ) , and Shahin II ( a large caliber 20km artillery rocket ) inventory during 1987 .

By 1 April , the Persian total had reached 258 ; however , only 61 were Shehab-1s , in comparison to 129 Iraqi al-Husayn missiles .
From this point on , the number of Shehab-1 and Oghab launches quickly declined as Iran depleted its inventory .
For a variety of reasons , Iraq -- feeling victorious -- declared a unilateral cease-fire on 21 April 1988 .
During the 52 days of the War of the Cities , approximately 532 rockets and missiles had been launched by both sides .
Within four months of the end of the second War of the Cities , and following a continuing string of Iraqi victories ( most notably on the Fao Peninsula ) , Iran sued for peace .

On 8 August 1988 , after eight years of brutal fighting and tens of thousands of casualties , the Iran - Iraq war came to a formal end .
Iran had not only been defeated on the battlefield , it had , more significantly , been defeated at home .
Its economy was depleted , its civilian industry near collapse , and its population was simply exhausted from the war .
Building upon the foundations established during the war , Iran 's missile and long - range artillery rocket programs were reorganized during the late 1980s and have developed along two broad paths -- solid - fueled and liquid - fueled systems .
The solid - fuel component built upon the foundation laid with the Oghab and Shahin-II programs and would lead to the Fajr , Nazeat , and Zelzal families of long - range artillery rockets .
This effort has relied heavily upon PRC assistance .
This effort has relied heavily upon Pr assistance .
This effort has relied heavily upon Marketing assistance .
Sometime during 1988 , it is believed that the PRC agreed to assist Iran modernize and expand its facilities at Parchin and Semnan to enable the design and manufacture of solid fuel artillery rockets and missiles of indigenous design .
Initially it was believed that these facilities would eventually assemble and then produce the M-9/DF-15 and M-11/DF-11 .
As part of this effort , agreements were reportedly concluded between Iran and the PRC during 1991, 1992 , and 1993 to provide Iran with technology , components , and complete M-9/11 missiles .
Available information suggests that , with the exception of possibly one - two prototypes , the PRC has not delivered complete M-9/11 missiles to Iran .
PRC - US agreements have apparently been the primary reason for the missiles not being delivered .
As a result of these agreements , the PRC refocused its efforts on assisting Iran with its indigenous short - range solid fuel systems .
As a result of these agreements , the PRC refocused its efforts on assisting Iran with their indigenous short - range solid fuel systems .
As a result of these agreements , the PRC refocused its efforts on assisting Iran with it indigenous short - range solid fuel systems .
This assistance has included the sale of production and missile component technologies , training of personnel , construction of the Shahrud Missile Test Facility , and the assembly and production of the M-7 ( a.k.a. , CSS-8 , 8610 or B610 ) .
During the war , Iran 's liquid fuel program had initially focused upon the production of a reverse - engineered Scud-Bs .
This effort quickly floundered for a variety of reasons and was refocused on the assembly and maintenance of the DPRK produced Scud-B/Hwasong-5 -- known locally as the Shehab-1 .
This program would subsequently lead into the Shehab-2 ( Scud-C/Hwasong-6 ) and Shehab-3 ( Nodong ) programs .
These programs rely heavily upon DPRK and Russian technology and assistance .
Although since the late 1990s , DPRK technology and assistance have been declining as Russian has been increasing .
Although since the late 1990s , russian technology and assistance have been declining as Russian has been increasing .
Although since the late 1990s , its technology and assistance have been declining as Russian has been increasing .
More advance liquid fuel programs include the Shehab-4 and Shehab-5 .
These programs are believed to rely heavily upon the assistance from numerous Russian and Eastern European entities .
During mid - 2001 , Iran is reported to have initiated a comprehensive review and reorganization of its diverse rocket and missile development programs .
This effort is believed to have been initiated in an effort to prioritize and rationalize the entire development and production infrastructure and reduce costs .
How this will affect the various programs is presently unclear .
There are conflicting indications as to the level of coordination and integration of DPRK and PRC assistance within Iran .
There are unclear indications as to the level of coordination and integration of DPRK and PRC assistance within Iran .
There are differing indications as to the level of coordination and integration of DPRK and PRC assistance within Iran .
Some sources suggest that it is very close .
Other sources suggest that while Iran is receiving assistance from both the PRC and DPRK with their missile programs , the two countries are working independently , but in coordination .
While the level of assistance provided by Russian entities since the early 1990s is significant , it is presently unclear as to the level of cooperation and coordination among the various Russian , PRC , and DPRK entities within Iran .
Iran 's post - war missile programs have also benefited at times from bilateral cooperation with Pakistan and the acquisition of production hardware , non - restricted components , and restricted components from the former Soviet Union ( e.g. , Belarus , Ukraine , Kazakhstan , and Uzbekistan ) and European countries .

In addition , Iran has made a concerted effort to lure back scientists and technical experts who fled the country at the time of the Islamic revolution .
These personnel have the potential to bring back a tremendous wealth of technical expertise and experience .
By 2000 , Iran 's ballistic missile effort would become the `` ... the largest in the Middle East ... '' and would rival that of the DPRK in size and scope .
As of late 2003 , Iran possesses the second largest ballistic missile force in the third world ( behind that of the DPRK ) and is on the verge of developing a space launch vehicle and intercontinental ballistic missiles .

The United States has cited numerous cases of Iran receiving assistance in its missile production from countries such as North Korea and Russia , and has even placed sanctions on private companies for aiding Iran .
Iranian Defense and Foreign Ministry officials continue to defend Iran 's right to protect itself from potential threats in the region , while denying any ill intent towards countries such as the United States .
As of early September 2004 , Iran was cited as testing its Shehab-3 missile for a second time , further proving its persistence to test and develop its extended range missile capabilities .
US officials ' growing concerns about Iran 's pursuit of weapons of mass destruction capabilities were heightened by the latest test of the Shehab-3 on October 20 .

The relative numbers of Shehab-1 and Shehab-2 systems could change in favor of the Shehab-2 if Iran undertakes to upgrade the earlier systems to Shehab-2 configuration .
Reliable estimates of long - range artillery rocket ( e.g. , Fajr , Nazeat and Zelzal ) inventories are unavailable .

US - led Operations Desert Storm and Iraqi Freedom -- while first reducing and then eliminating the military threat from Iraq -- have also crystallized within the Iranian military and political leadership the concepts on ballistic and cruise missiles and long - range artillery rockets : they are essential tools on the modern battlefield ; key elements in regional power status and prestige ; and essential to deter Israel and the United States from aggressive actions against Iran .
From a proliferation standpoint , Iran currently presents a number of challenges .
Primary among these are : The continued willingness of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea ( DPRK ) , the People's Republic of China ( PRC ) , and Russia to provide Iran with both missiles and missile - related technology that at the very least exceed the intentions of the Missile Technology Control Regime ( MTCR ) .
This has been complemented , to a lesser extent , by the willingness of other nations ( e.g. , Libya and Syria ) to cooperate within the realm of ballistic missile development .
The ongoing ability and willingness of Iran to fund the development of missiles and missile - related technology in other countries ( e.g. , DPRK , Libya , and Syria ) .
