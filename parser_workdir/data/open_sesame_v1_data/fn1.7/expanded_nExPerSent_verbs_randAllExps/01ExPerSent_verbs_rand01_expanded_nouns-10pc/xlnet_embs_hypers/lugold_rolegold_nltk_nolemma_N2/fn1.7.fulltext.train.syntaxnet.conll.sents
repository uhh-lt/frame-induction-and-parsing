Why Would Terrorists Want to Employ CBW ?
Why Would Terrorists Need to Employ CBW ?

There are several reasons why certain terrorist groups or individuals might favor the use of CBW over other kinds of weapons:
There are several motifs why certain terrorist organizations or organizations might favor the use of CBW over other kinds of weapons:
There are several factors why certain terrorist organisations or persons might favor the use of CBW over other kinds of weapons:
If used effectively , CBW are potentially capable of inflicting a large number of casualties -- more than is possible with conventional explosives .
If used effectively , explosive are potentially capable of inflicting a large amount of fatalities -- more than is possible with conventional explosives .
If used effectively , Bomb are potentially capable of inflicting a large quantity of injuries -- more than is possible with conventional explosives .
CBW can have a greater psychological impact than conventional explosives , as suggested by the 2001 anthrax letter attacks , which killed only five people but frightened millions of Americans .
Letters can have a greater psychological effect than conventional bombs , as suggested by the 2001 terrorist letter attacks , which killed only five people but frightened millions of Americans .
Letter can have a greater psychological affect than conventional weapons , as suggested by the 2001 embassy letter attacks , which killed only five people but frightened millions of Americans .
Terrorists may seek to obtain greater status or bargaining power by demonstrating that they have the technological capabilities required to develop , produce , and deliver CBW agents .

For instance , in 1996 an ethnic Koreans in China was caught exporting 50 kg of potassium fluoride to North Korea by way of cargo vessels bringing food aid to the DPRK .
For fact , in 1996 an ethnic Korea in Tokyo was caught exporting 50 kg of calcium fluoride to North Korea by way of cargo vessels bringing food aid to the DPRK .
But because sodium fluoride is also a precursor for sarin and soman nerve agents , the Japanese authorities arrested the individual ( himself a Japanese citizen ) for trading in a controlled substance .

And I think that 's remarkable to a number of individuals who are eh who are doctors and a lot of people in the public health community as well .
Dr _Gupto : On the other hand to be able to outline and do the thing that were talked about today to basically completely revamp the public health system so that local officials can talk to state officials that can talk to federal officials to be able to pinpoint exactly when a cluster of bird flu happens that takes probably a lot more money and a and a really a complete revamping of our public health systems .
Dr brown : On the other side to be able to outline and do the step that were talked about yesterday to basically completely revamp the public healthcare infrastructure so that local authorities can talk to county officials that can talk to federal officials to be able to pinpoint exactly when a cluster of bird flu happens that takes probably a lot more money and a and a really a complete revamping of our public health systems .
Dr johnson : On the other end to be able to outline and do the program that were talked about tonight to basically completely revamp the public care network so that local governments can talk to provincial officials that can talk to federal officials to be able to pinpoint exactly when a cluster of bird flu happens that takes probably a lot more money and a and a really a complete revamping of our public health systems .
Dr _Gupto : The other thing Paula really important is that they talk a lot about the fact that our- we 're a lot better at taking care of patients now than we were in nineteen eighteen , we have a lot of ICUs a lot of ICUs in the hospital behind me that can take care of critically ill patients .
Dr smith : The other point Paul really important is that they talk a bit about the reality that today we 're a bit better at taking care of patients now than we were in nineteen eighteen , we have a lot of ICUs a lot of ICUs in the hospital behind me that can take care of critically ill patients .
Dr johnson : The other part Michael really important is that they talk a bunch about the idea that yes we 're a way better at taking care of patients now than we were in nineteen eighteen , we have a lot of ICUs a lot of ICUs in the hospital behind me that can take care of critically ill patients .
Dr _Gupto : The problem though at any given time eighty to ninety percent of those ICU rooms are full so we just do n't have the surge capacity and that 's going to cost lots and lots of money to create a health system where we can take care not only of the ill now but the ill that might come in with a pandemic Paula .
Dr paula : The issue though at any given day ninety to ninety percentage of those Emergency beds are full so we just do n't have the surge capacity and that 's going to cost lots and lots of money to create a health system where we can take care not only of the ill now but the ill that might come in with a pandemic Paula .
Dr paul : The trouble though at any given moment seventy to ninety cent of those Hospital units are full so we just do n't have the surge capacity and that 's going to cost lots and lots of money to create a health system where we can take care not only of the ill now but the ill that might come in with a pandemic Paula .
Paula_Zahn : Uh let 's talk about the other ( ( problem ) ) of the plan where the president will spend uh or wants to spend a billion dollars to stockpile antiviral medicine like ( ( Tamaflu ) ) and ( ( Rolenza ) ) .
