There are several reasons why certain terrorist groups or individuals might favor the use of CBW over other kinds of weapons:
There are several causes why certain terrorist organizations or entities might favor the use of CBW over other kinds of weapons:
There are several explanations why certain terrorist organisations or organizations might favor the use of CBW over other kinds of weapons:
If used effectively , CBW are potentially capable of inflicting a large number of casualties -- more than is possible with conventional explosives .
If used effectively , Cb are potentially capable of inflicting a large quantity of fatalities -- more than is possible with conventional explosives .
If used effectively , Ab are potentially capable of inflicting a large amount of deaths -- more than is possible with conventional explosives .
CBW can have a greater psychological impact than conventional explosives , as suggested by the 2001 anthrax letter attacks , which killed only five people but frightened millions of Americans .
Time can have a greater psychological effect than conventional bombs , as suggested by the 2001 ant letter attacks , which killed only five people but frightened millions of Americans .
Year can have a greater psychological affect than conventional explosions , as suggested by the 2001 alien letter attacks , which killed only five people but frightened millions of Americans .

For example , in 1996 an ethnic Korean in Japan was caught exporting 50 kg of sodium fluoride to North Korea by way of cargo vessels bringing food aid to the DPRK .
For time , in 1996 an ethnic Koreans in Tokyo was caught exporting 50 kg of potassium fluoride to North Korea by way of cargo vessels bringing food aid to the DPRK .
For case , in 1996 an ethnic Korea in Yokohama was caught exporting 50 kg of salt fluoride to North Korea by way of cargo vessels bringing food aid to the DPRK .
But because sodium fluoride is also a precursor for sarin and soman nerve agents , the Japanese authorities arrested the individual ( himself a Japanese citizen ) for trading in a controlled substance .
But because sodium flu is also a component for sa and soman weapon agents , the Japanese authorities arrested the individual ( himself a Japanese citizen ) for trading in a controlled substance .

Dr _Gupto : On the other hand to be able to outline and do the thing that were talked about today to basically completely revamp the public health system so that local officials can talk to state officials that can talk to federal officials to be able to pinpoint exactly when a cluster of bird flu happens that takes probably a lot more money and a and a really a complete revamping of our public health systems .
Dr dear : On the other side to be able to outline and do the something that were talked about yesterday to basically completely revamp the public healthcare infrastructure so that local authorities can talk to governor officials that can talk to federal officials to be able to pinpoint exactly when a cluster of bird flu happens that takes probably a lot more money and a and a really a complete revamping of our public health systems .

Dr _Gupto : The other thing Paula really important is that they talk a lot about the fact that our- we 're a lot better at taking care of patients now than we were in nineteen eighteen , we have a lot of ICUs a lot of ICUs in the hospital behind me that can take care of critically ill patients .
Dr art : The other something Feel really important is that they talk a plenty about the way that yes we 're a way better at taking care of patients now than we were in nineteen eighteen , we have a lot of ICUs a lot of ICUs in the hospital behind me that can take care of critically ill patients .
Dr greg : The other stuff find really important is that they talk a bunch about the possibility that guy we 're a bunch better at taking care of patients now than we were in nineteen eighteen , we have a lot of ICUs a lot of ICUs in the hospital behind me that can take care of critically ill patients .
Dr _Gupto : The problem though at any given time eighty to ninety percent of those ICU rooms are full so we just do n't have the surge capacity and that 's going to cost lots and lots of money to create a health system where we can take care not only of the ill now but the ill that might come in with a pandemic Paula .
Dr dear : The issue though at any given hour twenty to ninety percentage of those Health beds are full so we just do n't have the surge capacity and that 's going to cost lots and lots of money to create a health system where we can take care not only of the ill now but the ill that might come in with a pandemic Paula .
Dr greg : The situation though at any given day seventy to ninety ratio of those Patient machines are full so we just do n't have the surge capacity and that 's going to cost lots and lots of money to create a health system where we can take care not only of the ill now but the ill that might come in with a pandemic Paula .
