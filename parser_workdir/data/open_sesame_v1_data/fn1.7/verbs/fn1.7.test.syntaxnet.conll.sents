Your contribution to Goodwill will mean more than you may know .
To help you see how much your contribution means , I 'm sharing with you The words of people who have lived Goodwill 's mission .
We want you to Know why your support of Goodwill is so important .
Your gift to Goodwill is important because people with physical and Mental disabilities sometimes need an extra hand to know the pride that comes with work .
`` I was sad when I could n't go to the snack bar to buy a soda .
Now I can buy a soda and spend money .
I like working and making money .
I have a savings account .
I can write my name on the deposit slip .
If I was n't working here ... I would be sad ... '' -- Maureen
Because turning welfare recipients into tax payers just makes sense .
`` When I first came to Goodwill I was a single parent with little or no self-esteem .
Coming to Goodwill was the first step toward my becoming totally independent .
I really like my job. '' -- Sherry
Because people want to work .
`` I 'd never finished high school .
I had no experience or skills ... The only thing I did know for sure was here 's a chance to change things for me and my children ... I rode a bike to Goodwill in the rain and snow .
I wanted to be there ... I had my second chance to change my life. '' -- Donna
Because teaching a man to fish will keep him fed for his entire life .
`` Before I got to Goodwill , I was on a mission .
I just wanted a job .
It did n't matter what the job was , I just wanted one .
I 've got more than a job ; I 've got a career .
My instructor played a role like no other instructor I 've ever had I appreciate everything that Goodwill has done for me. '' -- Cornell
Each year , we help thousands of people who face tremendous obstacles .
Their one common goal : they all want to work .
A robust economy helps by providing job opportunities , but to be honest , most of the people who are n't working today are quite simply the ones who face the greatest obstacles .
The kinds of services we provide help people deal with obstacles like health care , transportation and child care - problems that are big enough on their own without being compounded by factors like physical and mental disabilities , illiteracy and lack of job skills .
Last year , Goodwill helped 3,300 people find jobs that increased their self - sufficiency .
Your gift to Goodwill will be used directly to support services that will help even more find jobs .
Right now , there are thousands of people who do not know what it feels like to support themselves .
You can help them to know that feeling .
Please help Goodwill and help people find jobs .

In the short while since Goodwill helped him find his job , Robert has learned to thoroughly clean a motel room in about 40 minutes .
His job objectives call for him to do it in 30 .
He has no time to waste .
With the help of friends like you , Goodwill has continued to adapt our services to meet the human needs of our changing society .
We do n't waste time as we are helping the community .
And we do n't waste money .
The gift that I am asking you to make will be used to continue our mission of helping people prepare for , find and keep jobs .
In their December , 1995 review of the nation 's best charities , U.S. News and World Report called Goodwill one of the five `` Standout Good Guys . ''
The magazine stated that Goodwill ( as well as the other standouts ) is `` uniquely effective , innovative or valuable . ''
While I appreciate U.S. News and World Report 's endorsement , the true value of your support is measured by the way Goodwill takes on problems that affect all of us .
Every time we help someone find a solution to their employment barrier , the positive effects radiate throughout our community : The business community welcomes not only another worker , but a consumer with increased purchasing power .
Parents act as role models of self - sufficiency instead of dependency .
You and I know that solutions to difficult problems do n't just happen .
At Goodwill , it is the hard work of staff and those who benefit from our services that produces the kind of inspiring results I see every day : A Goodwill staff member addresses a group of welfare recipients : `` You can earn the money to support yourself and your family , '' she says .
`` You can get off welfare .
I know you can ... I did . ''
A participant in a Goodwill program rushes back from a job interview to share the results with his classmates in our desktop publishing training program .
Once his tears have subsided , he confirms what his classmates have already figured out : he just received a job offer -- his first in five years .
Addressing a meeting at a neighborhood center , a Goodwill staff member tells the audience how Goodwill can help them find and keep jobs .
At the next corner he tells five more .
In order to develop job skills , a man with some serious disabilities begins working in Goodwill 's industrial division .
It takes a long time for him to gain the self - confidence to work elsewhere in the community .
Eventually , he turns your support into a payoff for all of us .
He proudly leaves Goodwill to support himself .
Just like the respect we 've earned from U.S. News and World Report .
The people who can benefit most directly from your generosity have no time to waste .
Neither do the rest of us who feel the positive results of their success .
Your support helps provide real solutions .
Please use the enclosed response card and envelope to give generously to Goodwill today .
Older kids , like Tracy and Kerry , left homeless after a recent murder - suicide in Indianapolis claimed Mom and Dad .
Young adults , like Mary T . , a jobless mother of three , trying desperately to keep her kids out of trouble in a crime - ridden neighborhood .
There are thousands more .
Kids like Tommie J . , made a ward of the court because of repeated beatings by an alcoholic father ; Alice , sent to a group home to get help because of severe behavior disorders ; and John H . , a recovering alcoholic , rebuilding a relationships with his family so they can live together again .
Pleasant Run Children 's Homes began serving children nearly 130 years ago .
Then the task was to help children who lost parents in the Civil War .
Today , we serve children and families with a multitude of problems : emotional , physical , psychological and sexual abuse .
Some come from families where , through therapy , there is hope for reunification .
For others , `` families '' are the counselors are housemates at the group homes where they live .
The biggest tragedy is that the problems do n't go away ; they only grow .
In 1994 Pleasant Run served 346 children and 125 families .
In 1995 we will serve over 850 children and 340 families .
In 1996 , these figures will triple .
The children and families who come to Pleasant Run are given the opportunity to become happy , loving , and productive members of our society .
They welcome the chance to belong , to become self - sufficient , to regain their self - esteem and confidence .
For Pleasant Run to continue to serve abused and neglected children and their families , we need your support .
The Funding sources are shrinking , but the needs grow explosively .
Please `` help good kids get better '' by sending us a contribution today .
Your gift will give children and families hope for improved tomorrows .
Exciting , mysterious , glamorous - these words have described Hong Kong for at least a century .
Hong Kong is crowded - it has one of the world 's greatest population densities .
But it is also efficient , with one of the best transportation systems anywhere , and for such a crowded place , quiet - you do n't hear voices raised in anger , motorists sitting on their horns , or loud boomboxes .
Shopping never ends - there 's always another inviting spot just down the street .
You 'll find Hong Kong easy to get around , the people helpful , English spoken everywhere , and food that lives up to its reputation .
Today Hong Kong remains a capitalist enclave with its laws and rights intact , and China has promised that Hong Kong will continue in this fashion for at least 50 years .
Beijing 's announced policy of maintaining Hong Kong 's prosperity and stability makes sense .
Around the time of the transition there was much speculation about how things would change .
But in fact , once news of the handover vanished from the front pages , the people of Hong Kong returned to their usual topics of conversation : the economy and the price of housing .
The impression of the visitor today will be that very little has changed .
Establishments are no longer called `` Royal , '' Queen Elizabeth has vanished from the coinage , and the Union Jack has been replaced by the flag of China and the new Hong Kong flag with its bauhinia flower .
But in fact , there have been changes , many of them due to economic progress , new construction , and other factors that influence cities all over the world .
British social customs are still evident in the kind of polite service you get in hotels and in the long lines of people waiting for buses at rush hour .
The British population has decreased ; today there are as many American and Australian ex-pats as there are British .
To alleviate the problem , the government has become the city 's major landlord with the construction of massive apartment blocks that , though they have every modern facility , average only 9 square m ( 100 square ft ) in size .
Whole cities have been created in the New Territories , although the unimaginative architecture of these towns has been criticized .
The majority are Cantonese , born in Hong Kong , or from South China , but there are immigrants from all over China .
The Chinese people have been described as hardworking and pragmatic , attitudes that have contributed to Hong Kong 's success .
There are many stories of refugees who arrived with nothing in their pockets , set up a small sidewalk stall , worked diligently until they had their own store , and then expanded it into a modest chain .
Old customs are still followed : Fate and luck are taken very seriously , and astrologers and fortune-tellers do a steady business .
Before a skyscraper can be built , a feng shui ( see page 68 ) investigation must take place to ensure that the site and the building will promote health , harmony , and prosperity .
You 'll also notice that gambling is a passion , whether it be cards , mahjong , the lottery , or the horses .
Sightseeing in Hong Kong starts at sea level with the enthralling water traffic?—?a mix of freighters , ferries , tugs , junks , and yachts .
Hong Kong 's other , less developed islands , Lantau , Lamma , and Cheung Chau , provide getaways .
You can also take a ferry to Macau to find an entirely different kind of city , a unique blend of Chinese and Iberian culture .
It 's anyone 's guess what may happen in the future , but for now Hong Kong bristles with energy and ambition , and for the visitor , this beautiful city with its contrasts and variety is an exhilarating experience .
There 's no question that , if they 're true , they ... could lead to impeachment proceedings . ''
Is Chatterbox alone in thinking there is something strange and even disgusting about Stephanopoulos ' eager show of independence from the president ?
Stephanopoulos wants to run for the Senate and does n't want to seem a Clinton stooge .
By lending credence to the Lewinsky charges , and treating Clinton 's familiar defenses as the lies and half-lies they seem to be , Stephanopoulos shows he 's not a fool .
The trouble is that Stephanopoulos himself helped propagate those lies in the first place .
During the 1992 campaign , when Gennifer Flowers first brought Clinton 's philandering to public attention , Stephanopoulos -- as Clinton 's chief spinner , distracter , and all-around bullshit artist -- played a crucial role in discrediting Flowers and anyone else who tried to point out the truth , namely that Clinton had a disturbing zipper problem .
( Do n't say Stephanopoulos did n't know .
Simply put , Stephanopoulos did as much as any man to get the country into the mess he now so telegenically laments .
Early in the film , with the Flowers crisis in full bloom , Sam Donaldson interviews Stephanopoulos , who blames it all on the `` Republican attack machine . ''
`` Gov . Clinton has no character problem , '' Stephanopoulos declares .
Donaldson suggests that on 60 Minutes Clinton had admitted to infidelity .
`` He said he had problems in his marriage , '' says Stephanopoulos , correcting Donaldson 's deviation from the pre-scripted fudge-phrase of the day .
( Today , of course , the president 's defenders claim that Clinton admitted infidelity on 60 Minutes and that the fully informed voters simply did n't care . )
Near the end of The War Room , Stephanopoulos gets a call from someone who apparently claims to have a list of Clinton paramours , which he is about to publicize .
Stephanopoulos skillfully bullies and cajoles him into keeping quiet .
`` You would be laughed at ... '' he tells the caller .
`` I guarantee you that if you do this you 'll never work in Democratic politics again .
... Nobody will believe you and people will think you 're scum . ''
You might say that Stephanopoulos helped invent the philander-protection techniques that seem to have made Clinton so overconfident of his ability to not get caught .
He was one of Clinton 's principal enablers , to use a word employed by Maureen Dowd in today 's New York Times .
When Democrats wonder why there is so much resentment of Clinton , they do n't need to look much further than the Big Lie about philandering that Stephanopoulos , Carville ( and a cooperative campaign press corps ) helped to put over in 1992 .
Now the dissembler and enabler has become the scholar and ABC News analyst .
It 's as if Roy Cohn went on television in the mid- '50s to soberly rue the damage wreaked by Sen . Joe McCarthy , without any apology for his own role .
Stephanopoulos is cashing in without even going through the minimal motions of holding himself accountable for misleading the country .
If Clinton , as is now increasingly clear , was a time bomb waiting to explode , then Stephanopoulos helped smuggle him into the White House and muffled the ticking .
The crowded Kowloon peninsula and the booming New Territories on the mainland call for some serious sightseeing ; but we begin across Victoria Harbor on Hong Kong Island , where the city was first founded and which remains the center of government , business , and commerce .
No matter how many tunnels and transit systems speed cross - harbor traffic , nothing matches the ride on the Star Ferry from Kowloon to the Central District across Victoria Harbor .
As the double-decker boats get ready to leave the pier , bells ring , the gangplank is raised , deckhands in blue sailor suits man the hawsers , and a couple of hundred commuters begin a seven - minute sightseeing tour .
The big green - and - white boat weaves its way through an ever-changing obstacle course of both large and small craft , and the soaring skyline of Hong Kong Island draws nearer .
There are restaurants and a Starbuck's in the basement , and you can access the raised pedestrian crosswalk from the escalators on the ground floor .
On Connaught Road Central , you 'll find one of Hong Kong 's curiosities , the 244 - m - ( 800 - ft - ) long Mid-Levels outdoor escalator .
It ferries commuters from the Mid-Levels apartment complexes downhill from 6 to 10 am , and uphill from 10 am to midnight .
Just east of the Star Ferry terminal , you 'll come to City Hall .
Go through the underground walkway to Statue Square ; on the east side of the square is the Legislative Council Building , one of the few colonial buildings left in Hong Kong .
So great is the pressure on the available land that most of Hong Kong 's colonial architectural heritage has been demolished and replaced by new skyscrapers .
Despite protests by preservationists , there was little alternative .
Most famous is the striking 74 - story I.M. Pei Bank of China Tower , not beloved by the people of Hong Kong - its triangular prisms and sharp angles violate the principles of feng shui ( see box , page 68 ) and its radio masts stick up like an insect 's antennae .
The rival Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank is by architect Norman Foster ; built on a `` coathanger frame , '' its floors hang rather than ascend .
From inside the vast atrium you can view the whole structure as well as the mechanical workings of the building .
Two bronze lions , carrying out feng shui principles , guard its doors .
You can catch one of Hong Kong 's historic trams along Des Voeux Road and ride from Central to Causeway Bay ( see box , page 66 ) .
In 1904 , the narrow , double-decker trams ran along the waterfront , but land reclamation has placed them far inland .
From the Bank of China Tower , make a short detour up Garden Road and turn into Battery Path to reach the landmark St. John's Cathedral .
Built 1847 - 1849 , this usually deserted Anglican foundation is Hong Kong 's oldest church .
During World War II , the church was turned into a club for Japanese officers ; it was restored after the war .
Note the stained glass windows in the Quiet Chapel , designed by Joseph Edward Nuttgens in the late 1950s .
Behind the church is the 1917 French Mission Building , now used as the Court of Final Appeal .
The park 's 10.5 hectares ( 25 acres ) of landscaped gardens and lakes contains a large greenhouse that holds many species of plants , and an aviary of exotic birds .
In the park is the Flagstaff House Museum of Tea Ware ( see page 54 ) .
It 's in Hong Kong 's oldest colonial building , with exhibits describing the history of tea from the Warring States period ( 475 - 221 b.c. ) to the present .
If you leave the park and walk up Cotton Tree Drive , you will find the Peak Tram terminal .
The Peak Tram starts its scenic climb just across the street and around the corner from the American Consulate in Garden Road and makes its way , sometimes at a startlingly steep incline , to the summit at 398 m ( 1,305 ft ) .
The right-of-way travels past fancy apartment blocks , bamboo stands , and jungle flowers .
Passengers crane their necks for dizzying glimpses of the harbor .
The Peak is still the most fashionable place to live in Hong Kong , but real estate prices here are astronomical ; rents run around HK$50,000 a month .
The Peak Tram , originally steam - powered , was built to speed the wealthy taipans to their mountainside retreats .
Before the tram was built , sedan chairs and rickshaws were the only way to get here .
Since the tram 's inauguration in 1888 it has stopped only for typhoons and World War II .
However , on sunny Saturdays and Sundays you may have to brave a crowd lining up at the lower terminal .
During the spring and autumn festivals , when people traditionally seek out the hilltops , the throngs are so large you would be better advised to try another time .
At the upper terminus there is a four - level shopping center , the Peak Galleria , and the Peak Tower , which resembles an airport control tower and has shops , entertainment , and restaurants .
You can walk around the peak for impressive views of Hong Kong , the coastline , and the islands in 45 minutes on Lugard and Harlech roads .
There are also souvenir stands , benches for a rest , and perhaps Hong Kong 's last surviving rickshaws - however these are not for rides , but are a tourist photo opportunity .
These gardens used to belong to the governor 's mountain lodge , but the building was demolished by the Japanese during the occupation of Hong Kong .
Across from the mansion , the Zoological and Botanical Gardens ( gardens open daily 6 am - 10 pm ; zoo 6 am - 7 pm ; admission free ) provide a welcome oasis amid the big - city pressures .
In the very early morning the park is taken over by people doing tai-chi exercises .
Both young and old go through ballet - like movements in slow motion to discipline the mind and body .
The park 's zoo has a collection of weird and wonderful chattering jungle birds .
The Western District is one of Hong Kong 's oldest neighborhoods , and its narrow streets hold a collection of fascinating traditional shops and enterprises .
Opposite the Macau Ferry Terminal you 'll find the Western Market ( open 10 am - 7 pm ) .
It is more interesting for its architecture than for its shopping ; it 's situated in a four - story Edwardian building built in 1906 .
For an interesting glimpse of small and family - owned shops , walk along Bonham Strand East and West , Man Wa Lane , and Cleverly Street .
You 'll find herb and medicine shops , incense shops , chop makers ' shops ( makers of Chinese seals ) , and more .
Hong Kong University 's campus is spread along Bonham Road .
The University 's Fung Ping Shan Museum , 94 Bonham Road ( open Monday - Saturday 9:30 am - 6 pm , admission free ) holds a significant collection of antiquities : bronzes , dating from 3000 b.c. , and ceramics , including Han Dynasty tomb pottery .
It also has the world 's largest collection of Nestorian crosses from the Yuan Dynasty period .
Take the Mid - Levels Escalator to Hollywood road , known for its antiques and curio shopping .
Walk west along Hollywood Road until you come to Man Mo Temple , the island 's oldest house of worship ( though the date of its founding is subject to dispute ) .
Visitors entering the temple are confronted by a dense pall of smoke from all the burning joss sticks and the incense coils hanging from the ceiling ( these will burn for as long as a month ) .
The gold - plated sedan chairs on the left-hand side of the temple were once used for transporting the statues of the temple 's gods in religious processions .
The statues in the main shrine represent Man , the god of literature , and Mo , the god of war , a curious juxtaposition .
Go down one flight of steps to Lascar Row , popularly known as Cat Street , for more antiques and curio shops .
Walk up the steps to reach Caine Lane , where you 'll find the Museum of Medical Sciences ( open Tuesday - Saturday 10 am - 5 pm ; admission by donation ) .
The interesting Edwardian building was formerly the Pathological Institute , founded to combat the 19th century 's 30 - year - long outbreak of bubonic plague .
The old laboratory is still intact , and there are exhibits on Chinese pharmacology and the history of medicine in Hong Kong .
There are still bars and clubs here , but the area has become almost mainstream , and office towers are replacing many of the sinful old premises .
The Wan Chai waterfront is dominated by the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre , the largest in Asia , which includes hotels , theaters , and exhibition halls .
On Wan Chai 's Bowen Road , Maiden 's Rock , also called Lover 's Rock , is the gathering place for the annual Maiden 's festival .
Every August young women convene to light joss sticks and some even climb the nine - meter ( 30 - ft ) rock to pray for good husbands .
About 2 km ( a mile ) east of Wan Chai , Causeway Bay is second only to Tsim Sha Tsui as Hong Kong 's place to shop .
Silent for a time , the tradition has been revived and is a tourist attraction .
It 's not clear how the custom started .
One story has it that traders Jardine, Matheson and Co fired a private salute for a visiting tycoon , an act that incensed the colonial authorities , who felt that they had the sole right to issue such a 21 - gun welcome .
As a result , the merchants were forced to limit their salvoes to one a day - and from then on , they signaled the noon hour daily for all to hear .
Originally the temple was on the shore but reclamation projects have now left it high and dry .
Hong Kong 's gamblers are so eager to play the horses that , despite the opening of a bigger and better racetrack at Sha Tin , the Happy Valley Racecourse is thriving .
Up Tai Hang Road behind Causeway Bay is Aw Boon Haw ( Tiger Balm) Gardens ( open daily 9:30 am - 4 pm ) , founded in 1935 by the late Aw Boon Haw , who became a millionaire by producing the medicinal Tiger Balm .
( It does not , in fact , contain any ingredients from tigers , but does promise to cure a wide range of problems such as colds , headaches , rheumatism , gout , toothache , and scorpion bites ) .
Aberdeen , the island 's oldest settlement , once a pirate lair , is home to the `` floating population '' - the boat people who spend their entire lives on the junks in the harbor , some proudly claiming never to have set foot on land ( except for funerals , which do n't count ) .
The junks are a picturesque sight : children frolicking on the poop deck , women preparing food or playing mahjong , elderly folk watching the sunset , dogs and cats underfoot , songbirds in bamboo cages overhead - and all afloat .
The boats may appear deceptively primitive , but many of them have their own electric generators and all the modern conveniences .
There are fewer boats now than in the past ; many boat people , especially the younger generation , have moved to housing projects .
You can take a tour of the port in one of the small sampans , propelled by hand by women drivers .
A half - hour tour costs HK$50 ; pay at the end , or the driver may cut your trip short .
The food may not live up to expectations , but the fantasy environment makes up for it .
If you can get up early enough , you can attend the pre-dawn auction held at the vast local wholesale fish market ; otherwise , have a look at the street market that goes on later in the day .
The peninsula opposite the east coast of Ap Lei Chau island contains Ocean Park ( open daily 10 am - 6 pm ; admission HK$150 adults , HK$75 children ) , which has become one of Hong Kong 's biggest attractions .
It is divided into three areas : a highland , a lowland , and the Middle Kingdom .
Linking the lowland and highland sections of the park , a cable-car system offers spectacular views across to the islands of the South China Sea .
The Oceanarium is said to be the largest in the world , and the Ocean Theatre features displays by dolphins , killer whales , seals , and pelicans .
An enormous roller-coaster rising way above the sea , space wheels , and high-diving shows guarantee a day of excitement .
The Middle Kingdom is a recreated `` living '' history of China 's past , presented through a number of full-size replicas of shrines , temples , pagodas , palaces , and street scenes .
There are also demonstrations of traditional Chinese crafts , including silk - weaving , pottery , and papermaking .
Continuing around the coast in a counter-clockwise direction , Deep Water Bay offers a good beach and harbors .
It 's so attractive and so easy to reach that it 's packed with sunbathers all summer long .
The well-known Stanley Market ( see page 55 ) is a major source for bargain clothing and other merchandise .
Though much smaller than Hong Kong Island , Kowloon has almost twice the population .
If you walk east on the Star Ferry terminal concourse , you will find yourself on the wonderful Promenade , which begins at the clock tower , all that remains of the once grand Kowloon- Canton Railway Terminus .
The waterfront here offers unparalled views of the harbor and Hong Kong Island .
If you continue to the end of the promenade , you will be in Tsim Sha Tsui East , a busy commercial district built on more than 60 hectares ( 150 acres ) of reclaimed land .
Hong Kong 's major venue for the performing arts , the building has been criticized for its fortress - like architecture and windowless facade .
The center contains a concert hall with acclaimed acoustics , theaters , a library , an exhibition gallery , shops , restaurants , and bars .
The theater presents `` sky shows '' and IMAX films .
The Hong Kong Museum of Art ( see page 54 ) stands behind the Space Museum next to the cultural center .
It contains the Xubaizhi collection of painting and calligraphy ; galleries devoted to antiquities and ceramics ; and a gallery of modern Chinese art .
The Science Museum ( see page 55 ) is a state-of-the-art interactive museum that will teach you how everything and anything works from ancient sailing ships to the latest technology .
Just across Salisbury Road from the cultural center is the historic Peninsula Hotel , now expanded and modernized by a 32 - story tower .
Its restored lobby is Hong Kong 's most elegant gathering place ; afternoon tea here is a visitors ' ritual .
Kowloon 's main street was created by Sir Matthew Nathan when he was governor of Hong Kong at the turn of the 19th century .
At the time it was built , many thought it absurd to have a tree - lined boulevard running through what was practically a wilderness .
A few blocks up Nathan Road is Kowloon Park ( open daily 6 am - midnight ) , elegantly laid out with fountains , promenades , and ornamental gardens ; be sure to go up the steps to see the Sculpture Walk .
Farther up Nathan Street you will reach Yau Ma Tei , one of the older parts of Kowloon .
Turn off Nathan and walk down Kansu Street to find the Jade Market ( open 10 am - 3 pm ; see page 80 ) , with more than 100 stalls spread out in a large tent , just before you reach the overpass .
Hong Kong 's liveliest market scene is the Temple Street Night Market ( see page 55 ) , near Jordan Road .
Everything is sold here , from clothing to souvenirs to electronic goods , and the market is known for its street-side food stalls , where you can dine inexpensively on seafood .
The market runs all the way up to Tin Hau Temple , where you will find fortune tellers ' tables ( some speak English ) and possibly street performers singing Chinese opera or pop songs .
The temple is one of the many dedicated to Tin Hau , goddess of seafarers ; this one also houses an altar to Shing Wong , the city 's god .
In the daytime the temple ( open 8 am - 6 pm ) attracts worshipers , and its park attracts strollers and mahjong players .
Nathan Road goes all the way up to Boundary Street , which marks the boundary between Kowloon and the New Territories .
Birds are favorite pets in Hong Kong , valued for their singing rather than their plumage , and here you 'll find all kinds of birds for sale as well as elaborate teak and bamboo cages .
This ancient burial vault is believed to date back to the Han Dynasty ( a.d. 25 - 220 ) .
The barrel - vaulted chambers were discovered while excavating for a nearby housing project .
Surprises spring up on all sides : new industrial complexes alongside sleepy farming villages , skyscraper towns blooming in the middle of nowhere , Hakka women in their traditional flat straw hats with hanging black curtains , water buffalo , and flashes of azalea everywhere .
The New Territories can be explored by taking the Kowloon - Canton Railway ( KCR ) , which makes 10 stops between the station in Kowloon and Sheung Shui , the last stop before entering China .
Ask the tourist authority about its interesting Heritage Tour from Kowloon and other countryside tours ( see page 113 ) .
The main highway makes a circuit of the New Territories , beginning with the new town of Tsuen Wan , situated in an area of heavy industry just west of Kowloon .
One - third of all Hong Kong 's beaches are to be found in a single 14 - km ( 9 - mile ) stretch of this region 's shoreline .
Thus you will find `` 19 - mile Beach '' at Castle Peak Bay .
As you approach the border , you can glimpse the skyscrapers of Shenzhen .
The lookout point at Lok Ma Chau was once known as Hong Kong 's `` window on China `` - in the years of China 's isolation from the West , tourists would come to the lookout point here and rent binoculars in order to get a glimpse of the great mystery beyond .
This `` Temple of Green Pines `` is a spacious complex containing temples and pavilions , statues , and gardens .
It is known for its collection of bonsai and houses a jade seal more than 1,000 years old .
Among the ponds is one inhabited by turtles : Visitors toss in coins in the hope of bouncing one off a turtle 's head , a sure way of achieving good fortune .
It is built in a square , and the only way in is through the gate in the brick defensive wall .
Kat Hing Wai was built four or five centuries ago by the Hakka Tang clan , one of the Five Great Clans that migrated here from North China ( see page 11 ) .
Many of the old houses in the village have been replaced by modern structures .
The Tang clan 's earliest walled village was Lo Wai , which also has its defensive wall intact and is entered by a narrow gate .
Few traditional ancestral halls remain in China since the anti-historical destruction during the Cultural Revolution , so these New Territories ancestral halls are rare survivors .
Another such hall , belonging to the Liu Clan , is Liu Man Shek Tong in the village of Sheung Shui .
One of the most interesting sites in the New Territories is Tai Fu Tai , another rare survivor , this one a mansion that belonged to a Confucian high official .
The house was built in 1865 by a member of the Man clan who achieved the rank of tai fu ( mandarin ) by doing well in the Imperial Examinations .
The traditional Qing Dynasty style of the mansion is enlivened by a few Western touches : a Baroque - style ceiling and stained glass above the doorways , showing the builder 's up - to - date attitude at the time of construction .
The highway and the railway stay close together from Fanling , site of the best golf courses in the area .
Tai Po , just south of Fanling , is known for its market , Tai Po Market , which buzzes with activity daily from 7 am to 6 pm .
You can take a ferryboat through the harbor , past the ingenious Plover Cove reservoir , a water catchment area appropriated by damming and draining a broad inlet from the sea .
Teaching here is conducted in both Chinese and English .
Sha Tin is the site of the Monastery of 10,000 Buddhas , which looks down on a burgeoning town .
There are hundreds of stone steps in the hillside to walk up before you reach Man Fat Temple with its regiments of small gilt statues of Buddha lining the walls .
Some indefatigable climbers will want to go up to the top of the nine - story pink pagoda for a panoramic view .
There is a total of 12,800 Buddha statues here , plus the remains of the monastery 's founder embalmed in gold leaf .
Also here is the Hongkong Heritage Museum ( call Tel 2180 8188 for open hours ) .
The museum has an art collection , and displays of toys and other artifacts .
Down to earth , the Sha Tin Racecourse can accommodate over 80,000 spectators and is equipped with every imaginable luxury , including a giant video screen facing the stands , and for the horses , air-conditioned stables .
Sha Tin Rock , better known as Amah Rock , is actually a pile of several rocks that resemble a woman with a baby in a sling on her back .
Legend has it that a local woman climbed the hill every day to watch for her husband returning from across the sea ; one day the wife and her child were turned to stone as a permanent symbol of her enduring faith .
Closer to town is Lion Rock , shaped like a lion lying in wait .
It really looks the part ; the tourists know its name even before the guide can translate it .
Excursion companies sell a variety of orientation cruises of Hong Kong harbor that include a look at some of its 235 outlying islands .
These pleasant , but expensive , outings can lay the foundation for your own explorations aboard the cheap but usually comfortable ferries used by the islanders themselves .
From the ferry terminals on Hong Kong Island you can escape to islands without cars or cares , where the local people smile `` hello '' and , if you 're lucky , point you to a secret beach for the ultimate in quality leisure time .
For ferry information , call Tel 2542 3081 or 2525 1108 .
The mountainous island of Lantau is the biggest in the colony , and covers nearly twice the area of Hong Kong Island .
Chek Lap Kok airport sits on reclaimed land just off Lantau ; plans to build a bridge may change Lantau , but at present it is sparsely populated and makes a perfect getaway .
At 934 m ( 3,064 ft ) , Lantau Peak is high enough to attract the occasional rain cloud - refreshingly cool breezes blow on most hot summer days .
More than half the island is parkland , and there is a 70 - km ( 45 - mile ) circular hiking trail ( see page 92 ) .
Ferries depart from Central every two hours between 6:10 am and 10:30 pm to Silvermine Bay ( Mui Wo ) , where a bus terminal has buses to all parts of the island .
There are also ferries to Discovery Bay .
The most famous site on the island is the world 's tallest seated bronze statue of Buddha at 22 m ( 72.6 ft ) , the Tiantan Buddha ( see page 55 ) .
The monastery is strictly vegetarian , and visitors are warned not to bring any meat with them .
You can have a delicious vegetarian lunch here .
From the monastery , hikers enjoy the two - hour cross-country trek down to Silvermine Bay , but the authorities have warned walkers to be on the lookout for snakes , which can be plentiful in the Lantau hinterland , especially in summer .
Visitors are welcome to visit the 24 - hectare ( 60 - acre ) establishment , and may sample the end product , Lantau tea .
The island 's largest community is Tai O . The people of this picturesque village make their living by fishing , duck - breeding , and food - processing .
Many of the inhabitants live - by choice , not necessarily through economic hardship - on the water , aboard houseboats or in houses on stilts in the main creek .
To get here , follow the path from the southwest end of Discovery Bay ; the walk takes about 30 minutes .
Some 10 km ( 6 miles ) west of Hong Kong lies this small , crowded island , only one square mile in size .
More than 25,000 people live here , mostly by fishing , but there are also ex-pats , attracted by its laid-back Mediterranean ambience .
The island has a checkered past of smuggling and piracy .
That era is gone now , but other elements of the island 's old life are preserved .
The people still carve jade and build seaworthy junks , all by hand .
Fish ( heads discreetly wrapped in paper ) are still hung out to dry in the sun .
Cheung Chau becomes the center of Hong Kong life once a year , usually in May , during the Bun Festival , a folklore extravaganza ( see page 89 ) .
The rest of the year , life goes on at its accustomed pace : rickety machines chugging in two - man factories , children in school uniforms being ferried home to houseboats , and the old fishermen stirring shrimp paste .
By way of formal tourist attractions , Pak Tai Temple , built in 1783 , has some fine carvings and a great iron sword said to be 600 years old .
But the most interesting thing to do here is to explore the two villages on the island , Cheung Chau and San Wai .
The Praya , the promenade in front of the ferry pier , is a good place to observe the many junks and fishing boats in the harbor .
There are also several open-air restaurants where you can enjoy fresh seafood .
Only 35 minutes by ferry from Central , Lamma Island is perfect for swimming , hiking , picnicking , birdwatching , or just sitting back to watch the bananas grow .
Hong Kong 's third largest island has a population of only about 12,000 ; it is still largely undeveloped , and life on Lamma , if not totally primitive , is close to the essentials .
Archaeologists indicate that Lamma has probably been inhabited for some 4,000 years , and the island is known as `` Hong Kong 's Stone Age Island . ''
Both villages offer good waterfront restaurants with homestyle Chinese food , principally seafood fresh from the tank .
The ports are within hiking distance of several beautiful beaches , and within a one - hour hike of each other on a marked trail .
You can build an appetite for dinner by making your way from the beach to the restaurant .
Here , where East and West first met , life combines the spirit of Asia with something of the sunny atmosphere of the Mediterranean .
Colonnaded public buildings , iron balconies , winding streets , flagstoned squares and the many churches all speak of the Portuguese inheritance as well as the Chinese , a fusion of East and West that has produced the unique Macanese culture .
The story of the Western discovery of Macau begins in 1513 when Portuguese explorer , Jorge Alvares , reached the south coast of China .
Traders followed in his wake , setting up bases in several parts of the Pearl River estuary .
Finally , in 1557 , they were all consolidated in Macau .
It was the only European gateway to China , and through Macau flowed Western technology and religion .
In 1576 Pope Gregory XIII created the Macau diocese , covering all of China and Japan .
Lucky Macau fit the specifications exactly .
Portugal 's resulting near - monopoly of East - West trade understandably awakened the competitive instincts of other European powers .
The Dutch sent an invasion flotilla to Macau in 1622 , but the defenders triumphed .
China began to relax trade restrictions , and with the rise of Hong Kong , Macau became an isolated Portuguese outpost .
They were joined by a swarm of spies of all conceivable nationalities , and Macau won a name for international intrigue .
Portugal 's very precarious foothold on the Asian coast ended in 1999 with a formal handover to China .
Macau , now the Chinese Special Economic Zone of Zhuhai , is becoming something like a boomtown as an exporter of toys , furniture , and electronics .
New construction in the past 10 years has changed the city 's skyline ; with new , glittering hotels and highrise apartment blocks , the city is beginning to look a little more like Hong Kong .
Macau 's population is estimated at around 450,000 , an appallingly high figure for such a small area ; recent land reclamation has eased the situation to some extent .
If a trace of tropical lethargy still adds to the charm in this city of sidewalk cafes , palm trees , and pedicabs , any torpor definitely ends once inside the doors of Macau 's casinos , scene of some of the liveliest gambling west of Las Vegas .
Gambling provides almost 40 percent of the government 's tax revenues , and is a major source of employment .
Its spin-off industries , prostitution and pawn shops , also thrive .
Arriving
The easiest way to get to Macau is by jetfoil , operated by TurboJet ( Tel 2859-3333 ) .
The 40 - mile trip takes about an hour .
Jetfoils leave every 15 to 30 minutes 24 hours a day .
Entry procedures are similar to those in Hong Kong - most nationalities need only a passport to enter Macau .
Macau 's own currency , the pataca , is pegged to the Hong Kong dollar , and you can use your Hong Kong currency freely in Macau .
Outside the terminal , you will find taxis as well as buses to all points ( take 3 , 3A , 10 , or 10A to the historic center ; exact change is required ) .
You 'll also be approached by pedicab drivers ; these are tricycles carrying two passengers .
Directly across the street from the wharf where passengers arrive from Hong Kong is the first surprise to greet visitors to Macau - the vast Jai-alai Palace , said to be the world 's most luxurious fronton .
In an effort to provide yet one more thing to bet on , players are imported from Spain to take part in this lightning - fast Basque ball game .
Also in front of the ferry terminal is a new Cyber fountain , with 86 water spouts that shoot up to 70 m ( 230 ft ) and are illuminated at night by 288 spotlights producing 80 colors .
Continuing around the peninsula in a clockwise direction brings you to the Rua da Praia Grande ( Big Beach Street ) - a pleasant promenade with shaded benches under the banyan trees .
For an authentic feel of old Portugal , slip into the cool entrance hall of theimpressive Leal Senado ( `` Loyal Senate `` building ) , a fine example of colonial architecture .
The inscription over the archway reads , `` Cidade do nome de Deus , nao ha outra mais leal '' - `` City of the Name of God , None is More Loyal '' - a bit of praise attributed to Portugal 's King John IV in the 17th century .
On top of a hill in the center of the city , it 's approached by a grand staircase .
The rest of the building and an adjoining college were destroyed in a typhoon - fanned fire in 1835 .
The rich sculptural effects on the facade mix Eastern and Western symbols : familiar saints , Chinese dragons , and a Portuguese caravel .
Beneath the church , the Museum of Sacred Art houses a collection of sacramental objects .
It gives an overview of Macau 's history and its daily life and traditions .
The fort , built by the Jesuits in the 17th century as a defense against the Dutch , was largely destroyed by the same fire that burned St. Paul's .
Luis Vaz de Camoes ( 1524 - 1580 ) , the Portuguese national poet whose work immortalized that country 's golden age of discoveries , may have stayed in Macau .
Local legend claims that he wrote part of his great saga , Os Lusiadas , in what is now called the Camoes Grotto , situated in the spacious tropical Camoes Garden .
Those whose fate was to die on some far foreign field could not have wanted a more peaceful , lovely graveyard .
The small , whitewashed chapelwas the first Protestant church built in China .
Here , arched bridges , pagodas , fish ponds , and stands of bamboo create the mood of a timeless Chinese painting .
Photos and documents tell the life story of the physician - revolutionary - statesman , who lived for a time in Macau , but never in this building .
Surrounded by statues , carvings , and incense burners , here the faithful make their devotions and check their fortunes , and traditional funerary displays give a cheerful send-off to the recently departed .
An unexpected piece of historical memorabilia turns up in the monastery garden , where guides point out a small stone table used for a treaty - signing ceremony in 1844 .
Another important ceremony took place in 1999 when Macau became part of China .
The Handover Pavilion was meant to be a temporary structure , but public outcry ensured its preservation ( located on Xian Xing Hai ; open weekdays 10 am - 6 pm , until 10 pm weekends ) .
Exhibits cover fishing , seaborne trade , sea transport , and there is an aquarium .
The museum also offers boat tours aboard a fishing junk .
When they came ashore they found the A - Ma Temple ( properly called Ma Kok Temple ; open daily dawn to dusk ) , dedicated to the favorite goddess of fishermen , who is also known as Tin Hau .
The area was called A - Ma Gau ( `` Bay of A - Ma `` ) , and in this way , Macau got its name .
The remains of the 17th - century Barra Fortress , which once defended the southern tip of the peninsula , contains the chapel of Santiago ( St. James ) .
Among other legends surrounding the statue is a very modern one : During the Chinese Cultural Revolution , when Red Guards were running rampant on Wanchai island , just a swim away , the image of St. James is said to have stepped down from the altar and halted an invasion .
Part of the fortress has been converted and is now used as a luxury inn .
The Barrier Gate ( Portas do Cerco ) , which was built more than a century ago , marks the boundary between the enclave of Macau and the People's Republic of China .
Trying Your Luck
There are 12 of them ; you ca n't miss the eye-popping Lisboa , which has several floors of gambling , but there 's also the Hyatt Regency , the Mandarian Oriental , and Taipa 's Jockey Club .
The casinos offer familiar international games - baccarat , blackjack , boule , craps , roulette - along with more exotic Chinese pastimes .
Watch the fantan dealer for a few minutes and you 'll almost be an expert : It 's simply a matter of how many odd buttons are left after he has divided a pile of them into groups of four .
Dai-Siu ( Big and Small ) is a dice game in which the croupier throws three dice inside a glass container .
Keno is a variation of bingo in which the player chooses numbers to bet on before the draw is made .
The casinos have no admission charge and formal dress is optional , though long pants for men are required .
They keep busy 24 hours a day , but if you want a change of scene there are always more gambling opportunities available .
You can try your luck at pari mutuel betting on jai-alai at pari mutuel , greyhound - racing at the Canidrome ( one of the largest in the world ) , and harness - racing on Taipa .
You should always ask for a certificate of guarantee when you buy gold or jewelry .
Look for jewelry shops along Avenida do Infante D. Henrique and Avenida de Almeida Ribeiro .
Browsing is a real pleasure in Macau 's main streets and byways , where shops aimed at the tourist market are interspersed with the more workaday ironmongers , herbalists , and noodle stalls .
Knowledgeable visitors look for antiques - either Chinese heirlooms or leftovers from the gracious Portuguese colonial days .
However , you are not likely to find bargains , and you should be aware that unless you are an expert , you can end up with a fake .
Also worth investigating are contemporary handicrafts , both Portuguese and Chinese , from across the border .
Macau 's own cuisine is a combination of Chinese flavors with the flavors imported from Portugal , Brazil , and Africa .
Whether you choose to dine in one of the Macanese , Chinese , traditional Portuguese , or international - style restaurants , you will be treated to a hearty meal at a good price .
Imported dried cod ( bacalhao ) is the Portuguese national dish ; several varieties are available , usually baked .
Macau has an ample supply of Portuguese wines .
Try a vinho verde , a mildly sparkling young wine from northern Portugal , or a hearty red Dao or Colares .
Bridges link Macau with its two islands .
Since the construction of the New Macau - Taipa Bridge has allowed easy access to the airport , the population has grown to more than 30,000 , with industrial development , new apartment blocks , and luxury resort hotels .
The quaint Taipa Village , with its narrow lanes and colonial buildings painted yellow , blue , and green , has almost been completely swallowed up by the development of nearby housing projects .
Pay a visit to the Casa Museu da Taipa , and you 'll be able to get a glimpse of how Macanese families lived in former days .
A grand colonial house , fully restored and outfitted with period furnishings , provides the centerpiece for this expanding `` cultural village . ''
Not as developed as Taipa , it offers the joys of sand and sea and is known for its beaches .
There are restaurants , swimming pools , and changing facilities .
The waterfront drive parallels the shore of a Chinese island , and boats headed to China pass through the narrow waterway .
The small Chapel of St. Francis Xavier is dedicated to the 16th - century patron saint of missionaries , and has on display the elbow of the saint , along with the bones of numerous Japanese and Vietnamese martyrs .
The city still maintains its important gateway role .
Ever since 1957 the Canton Trade Fair ( officially the Chinese Export Commodities Fair ) has attracted throngs of international business people every spring and autumn .
Guangzhou , with a population of more than 5 million , straddles the Pearl River - China 's fifth longest - which links the city to the South China Sea .
This waterway accounts for much of the local charm and excitement , as the daily drama of the ferryboats , junks , sampans , freighters - and even small tankers and big gunboats - unfolds right in the center of town .
The river also irrigates the carefully tended surrounding farmlands , creating a beautifully lush , subtropical scene .
Guangdong Province has some of China 's most fertile land , and grows two crops of rice a year , along with vegetables of all kinds .
The scary traffic is a real experience - vehicles of all kinds jockey for position on crowded streets , missing each other by inches , and speeding on the freeways is rampant .
It seems that the picturesque older sections with their old houses , narrow streets , and winding alleyways may not be around much longer .
Arriving in Guangzhou
There are many package tours to Guangzhou from Hong Kong ( see page 113 ) , and this may be the easiest way to visit the city .
However , it 's also easy to get to Guangzhou by train or ferry .
Four comfortable express trains depart the Kowloon - Canton Railway ( KCR ) Station in Hung Hom , Kowloon , making the trip in less than two hours .
Turbo Cat ferries leave the China Hong Kong City ( CHKC ) terminal twice a day ; the journey takes two hours .
Citibus also travels to Guangzhou from CHKC ; there are five round-trips a day , taking 3 1/2 hours .
You will need a visa to enter China ( see page 109 for information ) .
Hong Kong currency is widely accepted in Guangzhou , or you can change your currency into RMB ( yuan ) at any bank or hotel .
Note , however , that the exchange does not go the other way ( see page 116 ) .
If you travel by train , you will arrive at the Guangzhou East Station , a large modern complex , which connects with the subway , buses , hotel transfer services , and taxis .
Actually a five - story pavilion on a hilltop , it contains a fine collection of historical exhibits .
Dr . Sun Yat-sen 's Memorial Hall honors the founder of the Chinese Revolution , flanked by his heroic statue in copper .
Dr . Sun Yat-sen ( 1866 - 1925 ) began his political career in Canton .
This enormous , modern version of a traditional Chinese building , with sweeping blue tile roofs , contains an auditorium big enough to seat 4,700 people .
It was built in 1931 with contributions from overseas Chinese .
It celebrates the founding of Guangzhou , when five spirits rode their goats down from the celestial realm to present the inhabitants of the city with their very first grains of rice .
Although the banyan trees that once flourished here are now no more , the often - restored complex has remained a focus of local Buddhist activities .
Golden Buddha statues in several of Buddha 's aspects adorn the temples , and overlooking them is the 17 - story Flower Pagoda , a slender relic of the Song dynasty ( a.d. 960 - 1279 ) .
In the early Middle Ages , Canton had a significant Muslim population as a result of its trade with the Middle East .
This explains the presence in Guangzhou of the Huaisheng Mosque , reputed to be China 's oldest , and traditionally dated a.d. 627 .
Rebuilt in modern times , the mosque serves the small local community of Muslims .
Chen Jia Ci , the Chen Family Institute ( open daily 8:30 am - 5 pm ) , was built in the late 19th century to promote arts and crafts .
Porcelain friezes adorn the rooftops and ridgepoles , telling the story of the Romance of the Three Kingdoms .
There is also a market and a porcelain shop .
A former Confucian temple is presently the home of the historic National Peasant Movement Institute , where the Chinese Communist Party trained its leaders in the 1920s .
Zhou Enlai also taught here .
The atmosphere of 19th - century Canton is best evoked on Shamian Island , a haunting , nostalgic place in the Pearl River .
The bridges were barred by night with iron gates to keep the Chinese out .
Its stately European - style buildings have since been restored , largely for use as government offices and foreign legations .
The island also has Guangzhou 's first modern luxury resort hotel .
A popular optional excursion is an hour 's detour to Guangzhou Zoo , founded in 1958 .
It houses more than 200 animal species , most famous of which is the giant panda , and has an imaginative monkey mountain behind a moat .
Not to be missed is a visit to Guangzhou 's famous open-air market , Qing Ping .
The Cantonese love to eat and have the reputation of eating almost anything that walks on four legs .
The market bears this out : Along with the usual ducks and chickens , you will see for sale snakes , dogs , bats , and sometimes monkeys - all are highly prized as delicacies .
More pleasantly , you can browse among lanes of antiques , flowers , herbs , fruit , goldfish , songbirds , and more .
A very popular day - trip from Guangzhou goes to Foshan , a city of nearly 300,000 people , renowned for its handicrafts for more than a thousand years .
The individual artisans ' shops are no longer here , but you can visit a silk - weaving factory , a ceramics plant , and the Foshan Folk Art Studio , where you can observe workers making Chinese lanterns , carving sculptures , painting scrolls , and cutting intricate designs in paper .
The Foshan Art Porcelain Factory has traditional designs , but also some attractive modern pieces .
Foshan 's most outstanding artistic monument is Zu Miao , the Taoist Ancestral Temple , a Sung dynasty establishment rebuilt in the 14th century and well worth visiting .
Constructed in wood , brick , stone , ceramic , and bronze , this is a work of extravagant beauty , uniting many ancient art forms .
The complex contains the oldest wooden stage in China , used by the Wan Fu Tai Chinese opera .
Literally created out of rural farmland , it was set up in the 1970s as the answer to Hong Kong .
From a population of 20,000 it has grown into a metropolis of 2.5 million , with tightly clustered skyscrapers and some of China 's highest grossing industries .
Because Shenzhen is much cheaper than Hong Kong , it is a popular weekend destination for Hong Kong 's Chinese , who come to relax , dine in its resorts , and play golf - Shenzhen hosted the World Cup of Golf in 1995 .
It is even becoming something of a commuter town - owning or renting an apartment here costs a fraction of what it would in Hong Kong .
Shenzhen is easy to reach - the KCR commuter train runs throughout the day , the trip taking about 40 minutes .
Visitors need a visa to enter China , and must disembark at the border ( now called `` boundary '' ) checkpoint , Lo Wai .
City buses also go to Shenzhen .
It is known for its inexpensive ( but well - made ) knock-off designer goods .
You can use your Hong Kong dollars here , so there 's no need to change currency .
Just across the border is the huge Lo Wu City shopping mall , to which you can walk ; other shopping malls are nearby .
One of them - Splendid China - purports to show `` all of China in one day . ''
It contains elaborate replicas of China 's chief monments in impressive detail , including a scaled - down version of the Great Wall .
The 24 China Folk Culture Villages represent China 's ethnic variety ; they feature craftspeople in traditional costumes along with folksong and dance performances .

Iraq clears visit by Ohio official By Scott Montgomery
The Iraqi government has agreed to let U.S. Rep . Tony Hall visit the country next week to assess a humanitarian crisis that has festered since the Gulf War of 1990 , Hall 's office said Monday .
The Dayton Democrat , who has traveled to other crisis points including Sierra Leone and North Korea , will spend three days visiting hospitals and other facilities to seek understanding why aid has been ineffective in stemming malnourishment and other medical problems .
Iraq has been under economic sanctions since the war ended , which some say have thwarted the country 's ability to recover from the devastation of the bombing campaign .
The Persian Gulf War destroyed much of the country 's medical infrastructure , according to a report by the World Health Organization .
In 1996 the WHO found that much of the population existed in a state of `` semi starvation .''
Hall will be only the second member of Congress to travel in Iraq since the war , according to Hall 's office .
The last visitor was then- U.S. Rep . Bill Richardson of New Mexico , who went to help a pair of U.S. oilmen in diplomatic trouble .
Hall flies to Amman , Jordan , on Friday , where he 'll spend the night before driving to Iraq .
Flights are not permitted into Iraq .
Hall is to return to Washington on April 22 .
He was acquitted in Jordan of charges that he had ties to Al-Qaida .
In a recent interview with Al-Jazeera he spoke against the Arab regimes .
Immediately after the interview , he was apprehended again by the Jordanian authority . ]
Sheik Rida , fear God .
You are not fair when you belittle Sheik Bin Baz 's blunder and exaggerate the one by Sheik Maqdasi ...
Sheik Maqdasi did not criticize Sheik Bin Baz 's only for his edict which emphasizes not to consider a regime an apostate if it has n't adhered to Islamic laws .
If , you study the evidences and statements released by these people , we tend to appreciate their ignorance which was based on prominent views .
We had done that before with others who were known for their serious blunders .
I 'm not going to illustrate these evidences and statements ; God is my witness , I do n't want to deceive anyone .
However , I will mention one of these evidences reiterated by them .
Indeed , the Sheik issued two edicts regarding the same issue that contradict each other ...
First , he forbade seeking the aid of infidels when the Syrian Mujahiddin asked Saddam Hussein to overthrow the regime of Hafiz Al-Assad in Syria .
However , he allowed the Gulf regimes to depend on the infidels in attacking Saddam Hussein .
[ He issued ] more edicts to accommodate the policies of the Saudi regime .
So , try to appreciate the Muslims ' position , especially if these suspicions are credible .
Brother Rida , I plead to you through this article to understand the views of others , just like we try to understand the views of those who went astray .
My dear sister , I hope all is well .
I hope you are enjoying your stay there .
I wrote a letter to Ayman .
Please print it on a thin paper ; may God reward you .
Please read this message if you have the time .
I hope I can communicate with you through the Messenger before you depart Turkey .
Send my regards to my aunt , uncle and grandmother .
Take back the stuff which Ayman asked you to carry to Saudi Arabia .
I have completed the invoices for April, May and June and we owe Pasadena each month for a total of $3,615,910.62 .
I am waiting to hear back from Patti on May and June to make sure they are okay with her .
Do you want me to pay Pasadena on Friday for these months or do you want me to hold off until I finish July and August ?
Again , I do not have all of the information for July and August , so I can not give you any numbers .
I need to forecast the money today , so please let me know what you would like to do .
Thanks you so much for working on these as fast as you have - there was a priority in getting them out .
However , as you know , the less cash outlay that we have right now the better .
Lets wait and try to offset the amount we owe them with what they owe us - so I say wait until you get July and August done .
What do you think the time frame is on this ?
Patti is the one with the details , I 'm just the deal maker and do n't have access to any of the systems .
All I know is what fixed priced baseload deals we have .
I have no idea what flows .
I hope Patti can help you soon .
Let me know if you do n't hear from her today .
If I can get all of the information today , I can tell you this afternoon .
It does n't take long to create the calc sheets .
I understand from Janine that you or Patti can provide me with the detail that I need .
If necessary , I can come pick it up .
I have sent Patti a list .
For payment , we have to forecast the money two days out .
So , if I know today , I can pay on Friday .
thats fine - we ca n't pay them anyway
On payment ... We are now having to forecast five days out .
If I do n't know today , I can not pay Pasadena until next Thursday .
So this is the reality we 're living in al-Anbar in general , and Ramadi in particular , that is the head Sheiks of some tribes , and symbols of the Islamic Party , sat with the Americans in Jordan , and other places , to fight terrorism and its people .
The Sheiks started teaching people about these ideas .
This conspiracy is led by two sides .
So they announced their war on the Mujahidin .
It increased during the elections for the new constitution .
Their danger was so great , that hundreds of people volunteered in the police and the army , and thousands of people participated in the elections , renouncing their religion , and listenning to the erratics .
First : If there were people who are raping thousands of Muslim women taking their honor , and stealing muslim money and land , and other people who do n't rape or steal , but they take the religion away from thousands of Muslims , what 's more important , religion , or honor and land ?
What we learned from Muslim scholars is that robbing the religion from Muslims , is greater than robbing their honor and land .
God said `` turmoil is greater than murder '' , and for those devils , their danger is greater than who rapes , or rob and steal money or land .
From what we saw , the damage caused by those erratic infidels ( Tribes Sheiks , The Islamic Party ) is more dangerous than the Shiites and the peaceful police as people call them .
You Sheik announced war on those , with the opposings of many sectors and scholars of decision making .
The brothers now are wiping out the heads of infidelity , as soon as they started , and never claiming responsibility , we found among us who wants to make fuss about it , and regretfully some of the brothers with us in the organization ( al-Qa'ida ) see it as nonsense , and God is my witness .
My Sheik , here 's some of the events that happened in Ramadi :
1- Sheik Nasr al-Fahdawi , Sheik of AlbuFahd tribe , was nominated to be the governor of Anbar , this man worked so hard fighting the ( Tanzim ) organization , with all he 's got , from money to power , and reputation in Ramadi .
So we tried this with him : First , we backed off during the elections .
They had checkpoints .
Utens of his tribesmen who started checking cars , they violated our brothers many times .
They even announced it , then our brothers attacked the field leader , the brain behind people revolting at al-Anbar in AlbuFahd .
So the brothers raided his house in the middle of the night wearing the national guards uniform and driving similar cars .
They took him and killed him .
Thank God .
The next morning his households and neighbors started talking to the tribe saying it was the national guards , they added that they heard some of them speaking English , meaning that the Americans are the ones who took Abu Dhari ( Sheik Nasr al-Fahdawi ) .
No one claimed responsibility for his killing .
2- Around the same period , our brothers on the other side of Uphrate river , killed Jasim al-`Awwad in al-Malahima and AlbuHazim .
He 's considered as important as Abu Dhari in AlbuFahd .
He 's a big spy / agent , invited Americans to his house for big dinner parties many times , regardless , our brothers did n't claim resposibility for killing him .
1- Sheik of al-Bubali tribe in al-Jazira , Sheik Sarhan , who 's one of the traitors , and every time one of their traitors gets killed , he shows outrage and packs his tribe with their guns against the brothers .
After the cleaning in AlbuFahd , the brothers killed three of the spies in his tribe , and for the first time there was no reaction against the brothers , but instead he came to them , asking for forgiveness , and he 's ready to cooperate .
2- Sheik of Albu'Ubaid ( Salah al-Dhari ) , who slaughtered thirty sheeps in one dinner party , where he invited heads and Sheiks of tribes in Ramadi , to encourage their youth to join the police and the national guard , and that 's two days before the murder of Sheik Nasr al-Fahdawi .
After that he announced his repentance at the mosque twice in front of Albu'Ubaid tribe , denouncing who joins the police and army , and sorry for all he 's done , without any pressure or threats from the brothers .
Also the brothers did n't announce the claim for any of the killings .
When Mazhar al-`Alawani a candidate for the elections was murdered , his pictures were all over Ramadi , where the entire Albu'Alwan tribe was supporting him , proud of him .
One day before the elections , the brothers killed him while he was visiting Ramadi .
No one from his tribe opened his mouth , instead they got more scared and weaker .
The same with the killing of Muhammad Saddak the Sheik of AlbuJlayb tribe , and president of al-Anbar revolutionists , who released statements in mosques and markets , promising to eliminate who he called Sheiks of sodomite and thift , and agents for the Zionists , like our brother Abu Mustafa Midhatt , our brother Abu Khattab , and Sheik Abu al-Harith al-Shar'i , and many others .
7- Mamun al-`Alwani , al-Anbar governor , attached to you the security report in Ramadi .
8- Zahir Muhammad ` Awwad al-`Ubaydi , manager of Sunni endowment , for attending the last meeting with al-Ja'fari , also for attending a conference in Jordan , that was presesnted to you .
1- There must be time priorities .
2- Must differenciate between the infidels , which is in the public eye , and who works behind the scenes , as a mastermind .
3- Must differenciate between who 's in the village , where relations are stronger , than it is in the city , where there 's different people with different ideas .
I 've g - I 've got pen and paper .
18 BILL : Um , tonight , ah , when you finish your normal QF , so for hour ending one -
22 BILL : - ah , we want you guys to get a little creative -
24 BILL : - and come up with a reason to go down .
26 BILL : Anything you want to do over there ?
There 's some stuff that we could doin'tonight .
2 BILL : It 's supposed to be , ah , you know , kinda one of those things .
7 [ they laugh ]
8 RICH : 'Cause the - the schedule I just got over here - well , you know what it says .
11 BILL : You just got a new one ?
And so that 's the one you 're gon na want to ignore .
15 BILL : [ laughs ]
20 RICH : Yeah , and whatever adjustment he makes today , is probably - tonight , is probably not gon na work , so we 're probably gon na have to check it tomorrow afternoon again .
22 BILL : I think that 's a good plan , Rich .
24 BILL : I knew I could count on you .
29 RICH : All right , I wo n't even put that in the book .
I think we know what we 're going to speak about .
Um , tell you what , i 'll start off .
Um I personally think to set a mark with the judicial system and we 're talking about criminal - criminal cases that they should bring back .
There is one state that does that by the way .
I want to say Oklahoma .
I saw report something the other night about it .
Um , but I think if we quit , uh , building these Taj Mahals with the color TVs and sixty dollars sixty thousand a year to keep an inmate in there - on a - on a - on a life sentence , we should start hanging them and get it over with and let 's just screwing up the system uh .
I just saw on the news last night that they said the average time a sentenced murderer , you know , is in jail is two years before he 's paroled and a rapists is like six months and a burglar is like two months .
Because they just say there 's either no room in the system , you know , in the jails for them or , you know , it 's just that it seems like the automatic sentences - if - if a judge has leeway on what he 's going to , you know , sentence someone for between , you know , two months and uh fifty years and you know what 's his whim to decide it should be two months .
This is true and - and - and - and - and the way the law reads , uh , if they sentence you to -
You know it 's crazy .
So what , you know , let 's quit BSing with the system .
Well , even if it 's life like you say , we end up spending sixty thousand dollars a year to keep some , you know , joker in there for life .
We could spend that money , you know , for starving children that are starving or twelve million other things would be more useful than that .
So to me if somebody has life , you know , beyond a reasonable doubt , they should - that should be it - you know , particularly for some of these really .
I mean there are so many just major major serial murders and it 's not just like one instance or something it 's just , uh , horrifying some of the murders that go on .
Yeah and the - yeah - there 's just everyday you hear on the news of another one like that um .
Just should n't be allowed to to even even live uh about the issue about sentencing by the judge .
The - the - judge presently has an opportunity to intervene .
Uh , when there 's - uh my understanding - when there 's , uh , a verdict and it , for example , there 's a hung jury here in Fort Worth two day in eight to four and bam bam the guy got off .
Uh , he was , uh , he - he - was a veterinarian and killed two - a father and a son - okay .
Right , yeah , I heard about that on the news , yeah .
Right rather than have to retrial the whole whole thing and spend all the money for people to , you know , go back to court and all the lawyers and i mean it just winds up costing the taxpayers a fortune - you know , a fortune - to keep doing that .
And the victims you know the family of these people that have been murdered they just have to have it dragged on for years and years before they ever get any resolution .
Exactly because it 's not next day they have the start the trial which is X number of months and just prolongs the situation that much more .
I think that that if it 's - if it 's - not a split decision , uh , go with the highest number and let 's just get on with the program .
Well if I - I saw on one of the talk shows this woman judge i believe from Florida and she just has just really stiff penalties and i saw that in in the hands of a judge that really was conscientious and really , you know , took the pains to give a sentence for what was deserved , it could - you could have a - a judge that would really make a good impact , but likewise you could have the flip side and have some judge that was paid off or you know had good - a good old boy network , or , for whatever reasons , you know , politics , just let all kinds of people through so he - he would have a heck - or - she would have a heck of a lot of power , you know , if used wrongly .
So , at least the jury system does something to prevent that , you know , or help it - with it - anyway .
I do n't know if it prevents it but seems like the jury system does have it 's advantages , but i also - i 've also heard on trials that sometimes they go through , like , three hundred jurors before they hand pick these jurors that they think are going to be the ones that are going to be the most lenient you know .
And i do n't know how much they 're getting just a jury of their peers at that point .
They 're really getting a select group .
It almost should be the first twelve people that they - you know - that have on a list are the ones that are on the jury and that 's it .
Yeah , yeah , I get back to Price 's comment when he , uh , was found guilty he said , well , he did n't have any blacks , uh , you know from his neck of the woods .
Well , give me a break you know .
You know .
He 'd have to have his whole family up there for him to feel like he 's got his peers or something , yeah .
Yeah , yeah , I mean you 're - you 're in Dallas so - everybody - i ca n't believe they can , uh , like in a murder situations , they look for juries who do n't know anything about the system well or know anything about the - the - occurrence .
You 'd have to be pretty dense .
You 'd be in - have to be in - a cave not to know what 's going on .
Or moving it to Lubbock or somewhere possibly is not the answer .
Oh , they 'd have to move it to Taiwan for people not to know about it practically .
Well , really , this is - breaks up my afternoon from changing diapers and mopping floors .
I mean , what can i say ?
My husband works for TI .
Oh hold it .
I thought i heard a holler there in the background but i was n't sure .
Oh yeah , i 've got the dog and two kids waiting here .
I am locked up in the laundry room .
Okay thanks a lot .
Oh goodness well i 'll let you get .
I enjoyed it .
There were only two men in the room , Sir Henry and Stapleton .
They sat with their profiles towards me on either side of the round table .
Both of them were smoking cigars , and coffee and wine were in front of them .
Stapleton was talking with animation , but the baronet looked pale and distrait .
As I watched them Stapleton rose and left the room , while Sir Henry filled his glass again and leaned back in his chair , puffing at his cigar .
I heard the creak of a door and the crisp sound of boots upon gravel .
The steps passed along the path on the other side of the wall under which I crouched .
Looking over , I saw the naturalist pause at the door of an outhouse in the corner of the orchard .
A key turned in a lock , and as he passed in there was a curious scuffling noise from within .
He was only a minute or so inside , and then I heard the key turn once more and he passed me and re - entered the house .
We tore away his collar , and Holmes breathed a prayer of gratitude when we saw that there was no sign of a wound and that the rescue had been in time .
To this post a figure was tied , so swathed and muffled in the sheets which had been used to secure it that one could not for the moment tell whether it was that of a man or a woman .
In 1945 , the twenty - seven - year - old Anwar al-Sadat and his friends decided to assassinate the on - and - off prime minister of Egypt , Nahhas Pasha .
Religious decrees were used to justify the assassination of Egyptian president Anwar Sadat .
The Islambouli Brigades is named after Lt . Khaled Islambouli , the leader of a group of militant Islamists who assassinated Sadat during a 1981 military parade in Cairo .
Islambouli and four associates were captured and executed for the plot to kill Sadat , which was carried out by Egyptian Islamic Jihad and another Egyptian militant group , al-Gamaa al-Islamiyya .
Islambouli , an Egyptian military officer and member of Al-Jihad Organization , assassinated President Anwar Sadat during a military parade in Cairo in October 1981 for signing a peace treaty with Israel .

North Korea established a nuclear energy research complex at Yongbyon in 1964 and set up a Soviet research reactor at the site in mid-2002 .
North Korea subsequently expanded the complex and built a number of new facilities , including a large plutonium reprocessing plant ( Radiochemistry Laboratory ) .
North Korea signed the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons ( NPT ) in 1985 but did not submit to International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) inspections until May 1992 .
Discrepancies between North Korean declarations and IAEA inspection findings indicate that North Korea might have reprocessed enough plutonium for one or two nuclear weapons .
According to a December 2001 National Intelligence Council report , the U.S. intelligence community ascertained in the mid-1990s that North Korea had produced one , possibly two , nuclear weapons .
In mid-2002 , U.S. intelligence discovered that North Korea had been receiving materials from Pakistan for a highly enriched uranium production facility .
In October 2002 , the U.S. State Department informed North Korea that the U.S. was aware of this program , which is a violation of Pyongyang 's nonproliferation commitments .
North Korean officials initially denied the existence of such a program , but then acknowledged it .
The U.S. responded by announcing in November 2002 that it would suspend heavy fuel oil shipments being provided under the terms of the Agreed Framework , which had led North Korea to freeze its plutonium production facilities .
Pyongyang then declared the following month that it was lifting the freeze on its nuclear program , ostensibly to generate electricity .
In late December 2002 , North Korean technicians broke seals and disabled cameras that had been installed by the IAEA in order to monitor the freeze .
North Korea expelled IAEA inspectors on 31 December 2002 , curtailing the Agency 's capacity to monitor Pyongyang 's nuclear activities .
The IAEA has not been able to verify the completeness and correctness of North Korea 's initial declaration submitted in 1992 , and the Agency cannot verify whether fissile material has been diverted to military use .
On 10 January 2003 , North Korea declared its withdrawal from the NPT .
The treaty requires a 90-day waiting period , but Pyongyang claimed the withdrawal was effective immediately because 89 days had transpired in 1993 when North Korea initially announced its intention to withdraw before `` suspending its intention to withdraw from the treaty . ''
In late February 2003 , North Korea restarted its 5WW(e) reactor , and in March , reports indicated that technicians were active at the Radiochemistry Laboratory , and on 2 October , the North Korean Foreign Ministry declared that the reprocessing of 8,000 spent fuel rods had been completed `` to increase its nuclear deterrent force . ''
On 12 May 2003 , North Korea declared that the `` Joint Declaration of the Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula '' of 20 January 1992 was no longer valid because of `` violations by the United States '' [ Note : the U.S was not a signatory ] .
Estimates vary on how soon North Korea could begin operating a uranium enrichment plant , but North Korea probably could not produce significant quantities of weapons-grade HEU until the end of the decade .
In April 2003 , Egyptian customs officials intercepted 22 tons of aluminum tubing from Germany that would likely have been used for a pilot cascade of about 100-200 gas centrifuges , which indicates North Korea is probably not yet ready to begin operation of a large-scale plant .
North Korea has reportedly established a facility to produce UF6 at the Yongbyon nuclear complex , which gives Pyongyang the capability to produce the stock of uranium hexafluoride ( UF6 ) gas to feed the cascades of centrifuges in a large-scale plant .
Since April 2003 , multilateral talks have been held in Beijing to resolve the nuclear crisis .
All parties have agreed that they seek a non - nuclear Korean peninsula , but it remains unclear how this objective will be achieved .

During 19-21 April 2004 , North Korean National Defense Commission Chairman Kim Jong Il visited China and reportedly told Chinese President Hu Jintao that `` the DRPK side will continue to adopt a patient and flexible manner and actively participate in the six-party talks process , and make its own contributions to the progress of the talks . ''

''
The United States is insisting on the `` complete , verifiable and irreversible dismantlement ( CVID) ) '' of the North Korean nuclear program before addressing North Korean security and economic concerns .
Although Pyongyang acceded to the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention ( BWC ) in 1970s , North Korea is suspected of having a biological weapon ( BW ) program .
Production of biological weapon agents appears to have begun in the early 1980s .
To date , North Korea has likely developed and produced anthrax bacteria , botulinum toxin , and plague bacteria .
North Korea 's chemical weapon ( CW ) production capability is estimated to be about 4,500 tons per year , though this could increase to 12,000 tons per year in case of war .
North Korea appears to have emphasized the weaponization of mustard , phosgene , sarin , and V-type chemical agents .
Reports indicate that North Korea has some 12 CW facilities where raw chemicals , precursors , and actual agents are produced and / or stored , and six major storage depots for CW ordnance .
North Korea also has placed thousands of artillery systems -- including multiple launch rocket systems that are particularly effective for CW delivery -- within reach of the Demilitarized Zone ( DMZ ) and Seoul .
Pyongyang has not signed the Chemical Weapons Convention ( CWC ) .
North Korea began its missile development program in the 1970s and tested an `` indigenous '' Scud-B ballistic missile in April 1984 .
Pyongyang subsequently produced the 500 km - range Scud-C , the 800 km - range Scud-D , and a 1300 km - range missile known as the Nodong .
In August 1998 , North Korea flight-tested the Paektusan-1 ( Taepodong-1 ) in a failed attempt to place a small satellite into earth orbit .
North Korea is continuing to develop the so-called `` Taepodong-2 , '' which is estimated to have intercontinental range .
The Taepodong-2 has not been flight-tested , but U.S. intelligence analysts believe it could be ready for testing at any time . Pyongyang has deployed as many as 600 - 750 ballistic missiles , including about 175 - 200 Nodongs .
In December 2002 , Spanish and American naval forces intercepted a North Korean ship loaded with Scud missiles , but then allowed the ship to proceed to deliver the missiles to Yemen .
There were rumors in 2003 of Burmese plans to purchase ballistic missiles from North Korea , but it is unclear whether any transactions have been completed .
In late January 2004 , North Korea and Nigeria reportedly agreed to a missile deal , but Nigeria backed out of the agreement in early February under U.S. pressure .
North Korea has exported missiles , missile components , and technology to Egypt , Iran , Libya , Pakistan , Syria , and Yemen .
In September 1999 , Pyongyang agreed to a moratorium on missile flight tests and later announced that it would maintain the moratorium until at least 2003 .
Syria has a small nuclear program that can be described , at best , as `` elemental '' to a nuclear fuel cycle program .
Although Syria does not appear to have ever pursued nuclear weapons , there have been rumors that it considered doing so in the early 1980s .
However , no nuclear weapons program has ever materialized or been initiated .
It appears that the Syrian nuclear program continues to be focused solely on civilian nuclear research , based on international cooperation , and set to support a continued domestic aspiration for a nuclear power program .
Assistance to Syria has come from various countries including Belgium , China , Germany , and the former Soviet Union .
The International Atomic Energy Association ( IAEA ) has assisted Syria on numerous projects including uranium exploration , uranium extraction from phosphoric acid , isotope production , construction of a cyclotron facility , development of nuclear research laboratories , and preparation for a nuclear power program .
Syria signed the Nuclear Non - Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) in 1969 .
It took this step to obtain the political and technical benefits that come from signing the treaty .
In the aftermath of its losses in the Six Day War , Syria felt that it needed broader support from the international community to guard against Israeli acts of aggression .
Additionally , the government wanted to take advantage of technical assistance from the IAEA and its member states that is only available after a state signs the NPT .
In 1979 , Syria established its Atomic Energy Commission ( AECS ) largely to manage IAEA assistance programs and to plan for the eventual development of a nuclear power program .
In 1983 , the IAEA assisted Syria in establishing an analytical laboratory that was equipped with systems for atomic spectrometry and various other experiments .
Five Syrian scientists were trained in Hungary , the United States , Yugoslavia , and Austria as a part of the project .
Also in 1983 , Syrian and Soviet scientists carried out a joint study on the construction of a nuclear power reactor in Syria .
This study was part of an IAEA cooperative assistance project to help Syria understand the requirements for developing and maintaining a nuclear program .
Although Syria has probably never attempted to indigenously build nuclear weapons , there have been rumors that it might be interested in obtaining such weapons to deter an Israeli nuclear weapons threat .
In fact , in 1986 , when questioned on his opinion of the Israeli nuclear arsenal , Syrian Chief of Staff General Hihmet Al-Siabi suggested that Syria would strive to achieve strategic equality with Israel including nuclear parity .
In the late 1980s and early 1990s , Syria began exploring its potential for indigenous nuclear resources .
Upon completion of several uranium exploration projects , Syria began experiments to extract uranium from its vast phosphoric rock reserves .
In 1986 , the IAEA and AECS constructed a micro - plant at the General Phosphate Company Plant in Homs to study the process of uranium extraction from phosphoric acid .
The plant would be the forerunner to a commercial plant if Syria obtained a nuclear power reactor and needed fresh fuel regularly .
In 1996 , Syria began developing a plant to recover uranium from tri -superphosphates using a similar technology .
In 1991 , China started constructing Syria 's first research reactor , a 30 KW miniature neutron source reactor ( MNSR ) to be located at the Der Al-Hadjar Nuclear Research Center near Damascus .
China provided Syria with approximately 980 grams of 89% enriched U235 to operate the reactor .
That facility went critical in 1996 and become fully operational in 1998 .
The MNSR gives Syria the capability to produce neutrons for nuclear analysis , isotopes for industrial applications , and radioisotopes for training purposes , but is unsuitable for weapons production .
In 1997 , the IAEA approved a technical assistance project to provide Syria with a cyclotron facility .
It was to be built at the Nuclear Medicine Centre in Damascus .
The Cyclon-30 cyclotron , provided by Belgium 's Ion Beam Applications , is the same model as the cyclotron in Iran , where it is suspected of being used to enrich uranium .
In more recent years , Syria has continued to develop its nuclear research facilities and other facilities to help manage its nuclear material .
In 1998 , the intergovernmental Russia - Syrian Commission on Trade and Scientific and Technical Cooperation signed of a memorandum of cooperation between Russia 's Ministry of Atomic Energy and the AECS .
Part of this accord was an agreement to construct a nuclear research center that would include a 25MW research reactor .
Syria 's nuclear program remains in the fundamental stages of development , with virtually no fuel cycle facilities in operation .
However , there are a number of operating research facilities in Syria , including the Der Al-Hadjar Nuclear Research Center near Damascus , a nuclear analysis laboratory , and the Scientific Research Institute ( SRI ) in Damascus .
In December 2002 , an Italian newspaper cited an Iraqi officer who asserted that Syria had allowed Iraq to store its weapons of mass destruction in Syria research centers .
These allegations were never confirmed .
In 2003 , Russian and Syrian officials continued their negotiations for the construction of a nuclear facility that would include a nuclear power plant and a seawater atomic desalination plant .
Open sources reported that the Russian Minister of Atomic Energy confirmed that discussions over supplying Syria with a power plant and a desalination plant were taking place .
However , the Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman refuted the Minatom statement and denied that any discussion had taken place .
Consequently , Syria 's quest for obtaining a nuclear power plant remains an unanswered question .
In 2004 , Syria responded to U.S. and U.K. pressure to relinquish its WMD by declaring that it is prepared to do so when Israel does the same .
The United States imposed sanctions in May , citing Syria 's pursuit of WMD programs as one of the reasons for this step .
A Syria - EU trade accord hurdle was resolved in October with agreement on a WMD clause , subject to final approval by EU foreign ministers .
IAEA chief ElBaradei has asserted that there is no reason to believe Syria was a client of A.Q. Khan 's nuclear proliferation network .
He stated that there is no evidence that WMD were transferred to Syria before the U.S. invasion of Iraq .
Aetna Life and Casualty Co. 's third - quarter net income fell 22 % to $ 182.6 million , or $ 1.63 a share , reflecting the damages from Hurricane Hugo and lower results for some of the company 's major divisions .
Catastrophe losses reduced Aetna 's net income by $ 50 million , including $ 36 million from Hugo .
Last year catastrophe losses totaled $ 5 million , when net was $ 235.5 million , or $ 2.07 a share .
The insurer has started processing claims from the Northern California earthquake nearly two weeks ago .
But because these claims are more difficult to evaluate and have been coming in more slowly , the company has no estimate of the impact of the earthquake on fourth - quarter results .
In the latest quarter , Aetna had a $ 23 million loss on its auto / homeowners line , compared with earnings of $ 33 million last year .
Profit for its commercial insurance division fell 30 % to $ 59 million , reflecting higher catastrophe losses and the price war in the property / casualty market for nearly three years .
However , Aetna 's employee benefits division , which includes its group health insurance operations , posted a 34 % profit gain to $ 106 million .
Third - quarter results included net realized capital gains of $ 48 million , which included $ 27 million from the sale of Federated Investors in August and a $ 15 million tax credit .
In the nine months , net rose 4.3 % to $ 525.8 million or $ 4.67 a share , from $ 504.2 million , or $ 4.41 a share , last year .
