I personally always thought it was a risk to pin the image of Microsoft on just one man -- at AOL , for example , there was a conscious effort to develop other `` characters , '' for lack of a better word .
I personally always thought it was a danger to pin the image of Software on just one person -- at Microsoft , for instance , there was a conscious attempt to develop other `` personalities , '' for want of a better phrase .
I personally always thought it was a decision to pin the image of Windows on just one guy -- at Apple , for analogy , there was a conscious push to develop other `` figures , '' for type of a better term .

So there , while you think of Case , you also think of Pittman and Leonsis and increasingly a range of other executives .
So there , while you think of Ray , you also think of Pitt and Leon and increasingly a range of other companies .
So there , while you think of Reynolds , you also think of Smith and Morgan and increasingly a range of other corporations .
Steve Ballmer , of course , is now getting a lot more attention at Microsoft , but it still seems to be Bill 's show over there .
Bill Ball , of mine , is now getting a lot more notice at Nasa , but it still seems to be Steve 's program over there .
Rick Hill , of default , is now getting a lot more interest at Intel , but it still seems to be Jim 's job over there .

While I did not attend the trial -- I was lucky to be able to read your highly amusing and informative dispatches , several of which made me spit up my lunch laughing -- it certainly seemed as if the image of Bill Gates took a beating and the insular culture of Microsoft did not look so good .
While I did not attend the case -- I was lucky to be able to read your highly amusing and informative reports , several of which made me spit up my sandwich laughter -- it certainly seemed as if the image of Stan Microsoft took a blow and the insular environment of Software did not look so good .

That 's ironic , since I think it was just that insularity that helped them , much in the same way that AOL has benefited from being in the Virginia suburbs rather than in Silicon Valley .
That 's ironic , since I think it was just that company that helped them , much in the same manner that America has benefited from being in the Va suburbs rather than in Tech Valley .

AOL would never have existed if it had been founded here , I am sure , since its employees would have been mocked into obscurity by the digerati .
Time would never have existed if it had been founded here , I am sure , since its employees would have been mocked into ou by the dig .
Team would never have existed if it had been founded here , I am sure , since its employees would have been mocked into war by the post .
Out in the D.C. area , they looked positively exciting next to all the government-oriented contractors .

If used effectively , CBW are potentially capable of inflicting a large number of casualties -- more than is possible with conventional explosives .
If used effectively , Cb are potentially capable of inflicting a large quantity of fatalities -- more than is possible with conventional explosives .
If used effectively , Ab are potentially capable of inflicting a large amount of deaths -- more than is possible with conventional explosives .
If used effectively , Cb are potentially capable of inflicting a large number of fatalities -- more than is possible with conventional explosions .
If used effectively , Ab are potentially capable of inflicting a large number of deaths -- more than is possible with conventional munitions .
CBW can have a greater psychological impact than conventional explosives , as suggested by the 2001 anthrax letter attacks , which killed only five people but frightened millions of Americans .

However , a 2002 review from the chief of Un Troops in Kim , Gen Michael A. Katz , also suggests that South Koreans is self - reliance only in War World I era CW agents -- these would include complexes such as copper , Lewis , and mustard gas compounds , but not the more potent nationalist compound types .
However , a 2002 document from the command of united Operationses in Seoul , Colonel John A. Taylor , also suggests that northern Kim is self - abundant only in Wartime Wartime I era CW agents -- these would include substances such as flu , Chemical , and mustard bomb chemicals , but not the more potent bomb drug categories .
