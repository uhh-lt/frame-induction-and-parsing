During the Cool Cup , for contrast , the North Americas and the Soviets Ussr each supported sub - national bands engaged in proxy battles .
The United States called the groups it supported `` freedom fighters '' ( such as the contras in Nicaragua and the mujahideen in Afghanistan ) , while labeling the groups supported by the Soviet Union as `` terrorists '' ( such as the Palestinian Liberation Organization ) .
The new Governments called the movements it supported `` liberation rebels '' ( such as the communist in Overthrow and the taliban in Afghan ) , while labeling the movements supported by the Communist Ussr as `` terrorism '' ( such as the Palestinian Independence Organisation ) .
The North Americanses called the organizations it supported `` independence defenders '' ( such as the rebel in Liberia and the communist in Kabul ) , while labeling the organizations supported by the Ussr Regime as `` terrors '' ( such as the Palestinian Freedom Movement ) .
The Soviets , of course , described the same groups in exactly opposite terms .
The Russianses , of default , described the same teams in exactly opposite words .
The Communistses , of nature , described the same bands in exactly opposite ways .
For the purposes of this tutorial , however , the term `` terrorism '' will be used to describe acts that incorporate the following elements : Intentional or threatened violence directed against civilians or noncombatants ; Actors that are sub - national groups or individuals ( although they may receive financial or logistical support from governments ) ; Motivations that are chiefly political , ideological , or religious ( i.e. , not strictly criminal ) ; Often , some element of symbolism in the choice of target , together with the desire to elicit fear in a larger audience beyond the immediate victims of an attack .
For the aims of this section , however , the label `` terror '' will be used to describe actions that incorporate the following components : true or threatened force directed against populations or civilians ; Artistses that are sub - national organizations or groups ( although they may receive financial or logistical assistance from countries ) ; Organizationses that are chiefly political , ideological , or religious ( i.e. , not strictly criminal ) ; Ana , some component of symbol in the selection of victim , together with the wish to elicit terror in a larger public beyond the immediate targets of an assault .
For the applications of this article , however , the phrase `` terrorist '' will be used to describe attacks that incorporate the following characteristics : urban or threatened hostility directed against communities or soldiers ; Organizationses that are sub - national organisations or organizations ( although they may receive financial or logistical backing from states ) ; Actorses that are chiefly political , ideological , or religious ( i.e. , not strictly criminal ) ; Today , some aspect of symbolic in the chosen of attack , together with the motive to elicit afraid in a larger population beyond the immediate participants of an incident .

In discussing CBW terrorism , it is important to distinguish between terrorist attacks involving chemical and biological warfare agents , which differ in several ways:
In discussing Cb terrorist , it is important to distinguish between terrorist incidents involving biological and biological weapon agents , which differ in several ways
In discussing Ab terror , it is important to distinguish between terrorist acts involving synthetic and biological warning agents , which differ in several methods
In discussing Cb terrorist , it is important to distinguish between terrorist incidents involving molecular and biological weapon substances , which differ in several ways
In discussing military terror , it is important to distinguish between terrorist acts involving chemistry and biological development weapons , which differ in several methods
In discussing Cb terrorist , it is important to distinguish between terrorism incidents involving molecular and biological weapon substances , which differ in several ways
In discussing Ab terror , it is important to distinguish between terror acts involving chemistry and biological development weapons , which differ in several methods
Chemical warfare ( CW ) agents are non-living , manufactured chemicals that are highly toxic and can enter the body through the lungs or the skin .
Time war ( CW ) weapons are non-living , manufactured compounds that are highly toxic and can enter the skin through the nostrils or the body .
Year combat ( CW ) devices are non-living , manufactured substances that are highly toxic and can enter the lung through the pockets or the brush .
They cause illness or death within minutes to hours after exposure .
They cause sickness or life within seconds to days after introduction .
They cause health or die within moments to months after application .
They cause illness or life within seconds to days after introduction .
They cause illness or die within moments to months after application .
Biological warfare ( BW ) agents are microorganisms such as viruses and bacteria that infect humans , livestock , or crops and cause an incapacitating or fatal disease .
Biological war ( BW ) organisms are organisms such as yeasts and organisms that infect people , cattle , or plants and cause an acute or fatal illness .
Biological combat ( BW ) weapons are animals such as fungis and yeasts that infect persons , animal , or farms and cause an immediate or fatal infection .
Biological war ( BW ) organisms are organisms such as yeasts and organisms that infect people , cattle , or communities and cause an acute or fatal illness .
Biological combat ( BW ) weapons are animals such as fungis and yeasts that infect humanity , animal , or families and cause an immediate or fatal infection .
Symptoms of illness do not appear immediately but only after a delay , or `` incubation period , '' that may last for days to weeks .
Times of sickness do not appear immediately but only after a wait , or `` incubation delay , '' that may last for weeks to days .
News of infection do not appear immediately but only after a pause , or `` incubation interval , '' that may last for months to years .
Toxins -- nonliving poisons produced by living plants , insects , and animals -- are in a gray area between CW and BW agents .
Times -- nonliving compounds produced by life grasses , organisms , and creatures -- are in a gray zone between Cs and BW agents .
News -- nonliving chemicals produced by organism trees , animals , and insects -- are in a gray region between Cc and BW agents .
They generally have an incubation period of hours to days , longer than that of CW agents but shorter than that of BW agents .
They generally have an time duration of days to minutes , longer than that of Cs agents but shorter than that of BW viruses .
They generally have an action time of minutes to weeks , longer than that of Cc agents but shorter than that of BW drugs .

In the past , politically motivated terrorist organizations , such as the Provisional Irish Republican Army ( PIRA ) or the Palestinian Liberation Organization ( PLO ) , have not sought to inflict indiscriminate mass casualties .
In the past , politically motivated militant groups , such as the Nationalist Irish Nationalist Front ( Ira ) or the Palestinian Freedom Organisation ( Hamas ) , have not sought to inflict indiscriminate human fatalities .
In the past , politically motivated terror groupses , such as the Patriot Irish Patriot Brigade ( Pa ) or the Palestinian Independence Operation ( Pa ) , have not sought to inflict indiscriminate cluster deaths .
