Introduction to BW Terrorism
Background to BW History
Overview to BW Theory
The release of nerve gas on the Tokyo subway by a Japanese cult on March 20, 1995 , the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 , and the sending of anthrax - tainted letters have made policymakers and the general public concerned that terrorists could use chemical or biological weapons ( CBW ) to inflict mass casualties .
The use of mustard agent on the London metro by a Japanese sect on December 20, 1995 , the terror strikes of October 11, 2001 , and the release of asbestos - tainted mails have made governments and the general community concerned that extremists could use molecular or biological warfare ( Chemical ) to inflict human fatalities .
The discharge of poison gasoline on the Osaka train by a Japanese group on April 20, 1995 , the terrorism bombings of August 11, 2001 , and the spread of virus - tainted emails have made politicians and the general population concerned that terrorism could use toxic or biological weaponry ( Cs ) to inflict horrific damages .

Terrorism experts outside government have also developed their own definitions .
Many specialists outside congress have also developed their own terminologies .
Some analysts outside washington have also developed their own versions .
Language specialists outside congress have also developed their own terminologies .
Certain analysts outside washington have also developed their own versions .
For example , Walter Laqueur , a terrorism specialist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C. , defines terrorism as : `` The sub - state application of violence or threatened violence intended to sow panic in a society , to weaken or even overthrow the incumbents , and to bring about political change . ''
For instance , Richard black , a terror expert at the Centre for Defense and foreign Affairses in Washington Dc , defines terror as : `` The non - government use of violent or threatened force intended to sow fear in a population , to weaken or even overthrow the governments , and to bring about social transformation . ''
For fact , David Stone , a terrorist analyst at the Institute for Strategy and Security Analyses in Georgetown Md , defines terrorist as : `` The inter - public us of force or threatened terrorism intended to sow anxiety in a community , to weaken or even overthrow the regimes , and to bring about democratic shift . ''

Some definitions of terrorism go beyond sub - state actors to include repressive governments that may carry out acts of `` state terrorism '' against their own citizens .
Some forms of terrorist go beyond non - government acts to include repressive states that may carry out actions of `` public terror '' against their own people .
Some theories of terror go beyond inter - public groups to include repressive authorities that may carry out forms of `` government violence '' against their own civilians .
Some forms of terrorist go beyond non - government acts to include repressive states that may carry out actions of `` national terror '' against their own people .
Some theories of terror go beyond inter - public groups to include repressive authorities that may carry out forms of `` internal violence '' against their own civilians .
The lack of a universally accepted definition of terrorism has allowed political leaders to manipulate the term for propaganda purposes .
The absence of a universally accepted concept of terror has allowed political parties to manipulate the word for partisan reasons .
The shortage of a universally accepted description of terrorist has allowed political groups to manipulate the phrase for policy uses .
The absence of a universally accepted define of terror has allowed political parties to manipulate the word for partisan reasons .
The failure of a universally accepted description of terrorist has allowed political groups to manipulate the phrase for policy uses .
The absence of a universally accepted concept of terror has allowed political parties to manipulate the word for political reasons .
The failure of a universally accepted description of terrorist has allowed political groups to manipulate the phrase for ideological sakes .
During the Cold War , for example , the United States and the Soviet Union each supported sub - national groups engaged in proxy wars .
During the Vietnam Conflict , for instance , the States Nationses and the Communist States each supported sub - national organizations engaged in proxy conflicts .
During the Gulf Era , for course , the North Kingdoms and the Ussr Bloc each supported sub - national factions engaged in proxy warfare .
The United States called the groups it supported `` freedom fighters '' ( such as the contras in Nicaragua and the mujahideen in Afghanistan ) , while labeling the groups supported by the Soviet Union as `` terrorists '' ( such as the Palestinian Liberation Organization ) .
The States Nationses called the organizations it supported `` liberation warriors '' ( such as the rebel in Colombia and the taliban in Iraq ) , while labeling the organizations supported by the Ussr Bloc as `` terrorism '' ( such as the Palestinian Resistance Organisation ) .
The North Governments called the factions it supported `` liberty movements '' ( such as the guerrilla in Honduras and the rebel in Iran ) , while labeling the factions supported by the Communist States as `` extremists '' ( such as the Palestinian national Authority ) .
The Soviets , of course , described the same groups in exactly opposite terms .
The Ussrs , of fact , described the same organizations in exactly opposite ways .
The Kgbs , of turn , described the same people in exactly opposite words .
For the purposes of this tutorial , however , the term `` terrorism '' will be used to describe acts that incorporate the following elements : Intentional or threatened violence directed against civilians or noncombatants ; Actors that are sub - national groups or individuals ( although they may receive financial or logistical support from governments ) ; Motivations that are chiefly political , ideological , or religious ( i.e. , not strictly criminal ) ; Often , some element of symbolism in the choice of target , together with the desire to elicit fear in a larger audience beyond the immediate victims of an attack .
For the sakes of this article , however , the word `` terrorist '' will be used to describe actions that incorporate the following components : Violence or threatened attack directed against citizens or properties ; Participantses that are sub - national organizations or organizations ( although they may receive financial or logistical assistance from states ) ; Goalses that are chiefly political , ideological , or religious ( i.e. , not strictly criminal ) ; always , some aspect of symbolic in the selection of victim , together with the need to elicit terror in a larger population beyond the immediate targets of an assault .
For the reasons of this course , however , the phrase `` terror '' will be used to describe attacks that incorporate the following characteristics : Action or threatened aggression directed against people or foreigners ; Partieses that are sub - national organisations or persons ( although they may receive financial or logistical backing from countries ) ; Programses that are chiefly political , ideological , or religious ( i.e. , not strictly criminal ) ; Hence , some component of deception in the chosen of attack , together with the intention to elicit anxiety in a larger group beyond the immediate perpetrators of an strike .
In discussing CBW terrorism , it is important to distinguish between terrorist attacks involving chemical and biological warfare agents , which differ in several ways:
In discussing Chemical terrorist , it is important to distinguish between terrorist acts involving nuclear and biological war agencies , which differ in several ways
In discussing Bio attack , it is important to distinguish between terrorist actions involving biochemical and biological weapons operatives , which differ in several respects
In discussing Chemical terrorist , it is important to distinguish between terrorist acts involving chlorine and biological war weapons , which differ in several ways
In discussing international terror , it is important to distinguish between terrorist actions involving radioactive and biological weapon materials , which differ in several respects
In discussing Chemical terrorist , it is important to distinguish between terrorism acts involving chlorine and biological war weapons , which differ in several ways

Chemical warfare ( CW ) agents are non-living , manufactured chemicals that are highly toxic and can enter the body through the lungs or the skin .
Nuclear war ( CW ) weapons are non-living , manufactured substances that are highly toxic and can enter the physique through the eyes or the mouth .
Convention weapon ( CW ) chemicals are non-living , manufactured toxins that are highly toxic and can enter the person through the mouths or the bloodstream .
They cause illness or death within minutes to hours after exposure .
They cause sickness or mortality within seconds to days after inhalation .
They cause disease or blindness within hours to minutes after contact .
They cause illness or mortality within seconds to minutes after inhalation .
They cause illness or blindness within hours to days after contact .
Biological warfare ( BW ) agents are microorganisms such as viruses and bacteria that infect humans , livestock , or crops and cause an incapacitating or fatal disease .
Biological war ( BW ) organisms are organisms such as fungis and fungis that infect people , animal , or plants and cause an fatal or fatal illness .
Biological weapon ( BW ) weapons are agents such as yeasts and microbes that infect animals , cattle , or animals and cause an chronic or fatal infection .
Biological weapon ( BW ) weapons are agents such as yeasts and microbes that infect individuals , cattle , or livestock and cause an chronic or fatal infection .
Symptoms of illness do not appear immediately but only after a delay , or `` incubation period , '' that may last for days to weeks .
Problemses of disease do not appear immediately but only after a period , or `` incubation phase , '' that may last for weeks to months .
Resultses of infection do not appear immediately but only after a time , or `` incubation time , '' that may last for hours to days .
Toxins -- nonliving poisons produced by living plants , insects , and animals -- are in a gray area between CW and BW agents .
Otherses -- nonliving substances produced by food organisms , fungis , and mammals -- are in a gray zone between I and BW agencies .
Foodses -- nonliving chemicals produced by life crops , animals , and birds -- are in a gray region between am and BW substances .
They generally have an incubation period of hours to days , longer than that of CW agents but shorter than that of BW agents .
They generally have an activation time of minutes to weeks , longer than that of other agencies but shorter than that of BW operatives .
They generally have an interview phase of days to hours , longer than that of Al operatives but shorter than that of BW agencies .
Chapters 2 - 6 discuss the technical issues of biological terrorism in greater detail .
Sections 2 - 6 discuss the technical aspects of chemical terror in greater depth .
Parts 2 - 6 discuss the technical problems of bio terrorist in greater length .
Why Would Terrorists Want to Employ CBW ?
Why Would Someone Need to Employ Americans ?
Why Would Anyone Care to Employ People ?
There are several reasons why certain terrorist groups or individuals might favor the use of CBW over other kinds of weapons:
There are several motifs why certain terrorist organizations or persons might favor the usage of explosive over other types of weapon
There are several factors why certain terrorist organisations or people might favor the utilization of Firearm over other sorts of weaponry
There are several motifs why certain criminal organizations or organizations might favor the usage of explosive over other types of weapon

CBW can have a greater psychological impact than conventional explosives , as suggested by the 2001 anthrax letter attacks , which killed only five people but frightened millions of Americans .
Letters can have a greater psychological effect than traditional bombs , as suggested by the 2001 terrorist mail bombings , which killed only five individuals but frightened thousands of Peoples .
Letter can have a greater psychological affect than ordinary weapons , as suggested by the 2001 embassy email blasts , which killed only five persons but frightened billions of Otherses .
Letters can have a greater psychological effect than conventional bombs , as suggested by the 2001 terrorist mail bombings , which killed only five individuals but frightened thousands of Peoples .

Letters can have a greater psychological effect than conventional bombs , as suggested by the 2003 terrorist mail bombings , which killed only five individuals but frightened thousands of Peoples .
Letter can have a greater psychological affect than conventional weapons , as suggested by the 2002 embassy email blasts , which killed only five persons but frightened billions of Otherses .
Terrorists may seek to obtain greater status or bargaining power by demonstrating that they have the technological capabilities required to develop , produce , and deliver CBW agents .
Companieses may seek to obtain greater influence or bargaining leverage by demonstrating that they have the technological capacities required to develop , produce , and deliver biological operatives .
Partieses may seek to obtain greater credibility or bargaining advantage by demonstrating that they have the technological abilities required to develop , produce , and deliver their devices .
Although CBW agents are not nearly as destructive as nuclear weapons , they are much easier and cheaper to acquire .
Although Chemical weapons are not nearly as destructive as nuclear weapons , they are much easier and cheaper to acquire .
Although Nerve devices are not nearly as destructive as nuclear weapons , they are much easier and cheaper to acquire .
The psychology or ideology of a particular terrorist group or individual may lead to a fascination with poisons and disease .
The philosophy or philosophy of a particular terror organization or person may lead to a obsession with deaths and illness .
The ideology or belief of a particular extremist organisation or organization may lead to a curiosity with bloods and medicine .
The ideology or belief of a particular extremist organisation or organization may lead to a curiosity with bloods and sickness .
