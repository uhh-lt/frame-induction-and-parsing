It used chemical weapons to respond to Iraq compound attacks on several times during that conflict .
It used chemical devices to respond to Saddam toxic attacks on several instances during that campaign .

Introduction to BW Terrorism

Assistant to BW Terrorism
The release of nerve gas on the Tokyo subway by a Japanese cult on March 20, 1995 , the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 , and the sending of anthrax - tainted letters have made policymakers and the general public concerned that terrorists could use chemical or biological weapons ( CBW ) to inflict mass casualties .
The use of respiratory compound on the Yokohama underground by a Japanese sect on february 20, 1995 , the terrorist bombings of Sept 11, 2001 , and the mail of ant - tainted messages have made policies and the general population concerned that terrorists could use molecular or biological warfare ( Cb ) to inflict worldwide deaths .
The launch of breath dioxide on the Hiroshima express by a Japanese group on April 20, 1995 , the terrorist events of August 11, 2001 , and the delivery of animal - tainted mails have made governments and the general populace concerned that terrorists could use compound or biological wars ( Bomb ) to inflict human fatalities .

Why Would Terrorists Want to Employ CBW ?
Why Would Terrorists Move to Employ Cb ?
Why Would Terrorists Wanna to Employ Ab ?
There are several reasons why certain terrorist groups or individuals might favor the use of CBW over other kinds of weapons:
There are several causes why certain terrorist groups or groups might favor the usage of Bomb over other types of weapon
There are several motifs why certain terrorist groups or organizations might favor the deployment of Weapon over other varieties of weaponry
If used effectively , CBW are potentially capable of inflicting a large number of casualties -- more than is possible with conventional explosives .
If used effectively , Cb are potentially capable of inflicting a large number of fatalities -- more than is possible with conventional explosions .
If used effectively , Ab are potentially capable of inflicting a large number of deaths -- more than is possible with conventional munitions .
Terrorists may seek to obtain greater status or bargaining power by demonstrating that they have the technological capabilities required to develop , produce , and deliver CBW agents .
Times may seek to obtain greater power or bargaining advantage by demonstrating that they have the technological capabilities required to develop , produce , and deliver Cb weapons .
News may seek to obtain greater prestige or bargaining position by demonstrating that they have the technological capabilities required to develop , produce , and deliver Rf devices .
The psychology or ideology of a particular terrorist group or individual may lead to a fascination with poisons and disease .
The ideology or agenda of a particular militant organization or organization may lead to a obsession with diseases and disease .
The genetics or nationalism of a particular terrorism movement or group may lead to a curiosity with drugs and disease .

Historically , very few terrorist groups have possessed the motivation , the organization , and the technical capability to conduct a successful chemical or biological terrorist attack , particularly on a large scale .

Yet although small terrorist cells may be more motivated to use CBW and harder for counterterrorism authorities to interdict , they may lack the technical and financial resources needed to produce and deliver CBW agents .
Yet although small terrorist groups may be more motivated to use Cb and harder for counter officials to interdict , they may lack the technical and financial funds needed to produce and deliver Cb weapons .
Yet although small terrorist gangs may be more motivated to use Bc and harder for field agencies to interdict , they may lack the technical and financial facilities needed to produce and deliver Bc devices .

Motivation
In the past , politically motivated terrorist organizations , such as the Provisional Irish Republican Army ( PIRA ) or the Palestinian Liberation Organization ( PLO ) , have not sought to inflict indiscriminate mass casualties .
In the past , politically motivated terrorist groups , such as the Nationalist Irish Nationalist Front ( Ira ) or the Palestinian Freedom Organisation ( Hamas ) , have not sought to inflict indiscriminate human fatalities .
In the past , politically motivated terrorist organisations , such as the Patriot Irish Patriot Brigade ( Pa ) or the Palestinian Independence Operation ( Pa ) , have not sought to inflict indiscriminate cluster deaths .
Mass - casualty attacks would provoke government authorities to pursue the terrorists so aggressively that they would ultimately be destroyed as a viable organization .
Time - scale incidents would provoke government officials to pursue the militants so aggressively that they would ultimately be destroyed as a viable group .
People - terror strikes would provoke government governments to pursue the groups so aggressively that they would ultimately be destroyed as a viable organisation .

Over the past few years , however , a `` new type '' of terrorists has come on the forefront .
Over the past few centuries , however , a `` new kind '' of terrorists has come on the air .
Whereas most terrorist groups during the 1960s and 1970s were motivated either by left-wing ideology ( socialist / communist policies advocated by Marxist - Leninist or Maoist groups ) or by national - separatist goals ( a group 's pursuit to become an independent state based on its ethnic , racial , or cultural make-up ) , the number of groups characterized primarily by religious beliefs began to increase in the 1980s .
Whereas most terrorist organizations during the splits and 1970s were motivated either by left-wing agenda ( socialist / socialist goals advocated by Marx - Lenin or Mao groups ) or by national - identity aims ( a community 's desire to become an independent nation based on its ethnic , racial , or cultural origin ) , the percentage of organizations characterized primarily by religious convictions began to increase in the 1980s .
Whereas most terrorist movements during the sovietses and 1970s were motivated either by left-wing orientation ( socialist / marxist programs advocated by Lenin - Communism or Marx groups ) or by national - nationalist aspirations ( a subgroup 's ambition to become an independent government based on its ethnic , racial , or cultural background ) , the list of organisations characterized primarily by religious religions began to increase in the 1980s .

According to terrorism analyst Bruce Hoffman , in 1968 , none of the 11 major terrorist organizations then active was religiously motivated .
According to terrorism analysis Wayne Hoffmann , in 1968 , nothing of the 11 major terrorist groups then active was religiously motivated .

There are indications , however , that certain personnel who were intimately involved in the program , including Basson , may have provided technical knowledge , equipment , or materials to `` rogue regimes '' such as Libya , to foreign intelligence personnel , to unscrupulous black marketers trafficking in dangerous weapons , and perhaps also -- if certain journalists can be believed -- to elements of a shadowy international network of right - wing extremists .
