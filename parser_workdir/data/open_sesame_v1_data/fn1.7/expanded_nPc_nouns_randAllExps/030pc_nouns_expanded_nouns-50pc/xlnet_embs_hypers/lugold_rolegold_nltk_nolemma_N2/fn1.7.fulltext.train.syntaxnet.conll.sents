Introduction to BW Terrorism
Background to BW Terrorism
Overview to BW Terrorism
The release of nerve gas on the Tokyo subway by a Japanese cult on March 20, 1995 , the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 , and the sending of anthrax - tainted letters have made policymakers and the general public concerned that terrorists could use chemical or biological weapons ( CBW ) to inflict mass casualties .
The use of mustard agent on the London metro by a Japanese sect on December 20, 1995 , the terrorist strikes of October 11, 2001 , and the release of asbestos - tainted mails have made governments and the general community concerned that terrorists could use molecular or biological warfare ( Chemical ) to inflict human fatalities .
The discharge of poison gasoline on the Osaka train by a Japanese group on April 20, 1995 , the terrorist bombings of August 11, 2001 , and the spread of virus - tainted emails have made politicians and the general population concerned that terrorists could use toxic or biological weaponry ( Cs ) to inflict horrific damages .

Why Would Terrorists Want to Employ CBW ?
Why Would Terrorists Need to Employ Americans ?
Why Would Terrorists Care to Employ People ?
There are several reasons why certain terrorist groups or individuals might favor the use of CBW over other kinds of weapons:
There are several motifs why certain terrorist groups or organizations might favor the usage of explosive over other types of weapon
There are several factors why certain terrorist groups or persons might favor the utilization of Firearm over other sorts of weaponry
If used effectively , CBW are potentially capable of inflicting a large number of casualties -- more than is possible with conventional explosives .
If used effectively , explosive are potentially capable of inflicting a large number of fatalities -- more than is possible with conventional bombs .
If used effectively , Bomb are potentially capable of inflicting a large number of injuries -- more than is possible with conventional weapons .
Terrorists may seek to obtain greater status or bargaining power by demonstrating that they have the technological capabilities required to develop , produce , and deliver CBW agents .
Companieses may seek to obtain greater influence or bargaining leverage by demonstrating that they have the technological capabilities required to develop , produce , and deliver Chemical devices .
Partieses may seek to obtain greater credibility or bargaining advantage by demonstrating that they have the technological capabilities required to develop , produce , and deliver Lethal weapons .
The psychology or ideology of a particular terrorist group or individual may lead to a fascination with poisons and disease .
The philosophy or philosophy of a particular terror organization or person may lead to a obsession with deaths and disease .
The ideology or belief of a particular extremist organisation or organization may lead to a curiosity with bloods and disease .

Yet although small terrorist cells may be more motivated to use CBW and harder for counterterrorism authorities to interdict , they may lack the technical and financial resources needed to produce and deliver CBW agents .
Yet although small terrorist groups may be more motivated to use Agent and harder for enforcement officials to interdict , they may lack the technical and financial infrastructures needed to produce and deliver Multiple operatives .

Motivation
In the past , politically motivated terrorist organizations , such as the Provisional Irish Republican Army ( PIRA ) or the Palestinian Liberation Organization ( PLO ) , have not sought to inflict indiscriminate mass casualties .

In the past , politically motivated terrorist organisations , such as the national Irish national Association ( Ni ) or the Palestinian Independence Authority ( Pa ) , have not sought to inflict indiscriminate public deaths .
Mass - casualty attacks would provoke government authorities to pursue the terrorists so aggressively that they would ultimately be destroyed as a viable organization .
Heavy - scale bombings would provoke government officials to pursue the perpetrators so aggressively that they would ultimately be destroyed as a viable organisation .
Multiple - death strikes would provoke government forces to pursue the attackers so aggressively that they would ultimately be destroyed as a viable group .

Whereas most terrorist groups during the 1960s and 1970s were motivated either by left-wing ideology ( socialist / communist policies advocated by Marxist - Leninist or Maoist groups ) or by national - separatist goals ( a group 's pursuit to become an independent state based on its ethnic , racial , or cultural make-up ) , the number of groups characterized primarily by religious beliefs began to increase in the 1980s .

There are indications , however , that certain personnel who were intimately involved in the program , including Basson , may have provided technical knowledge , equipment , or materials to `` rogue regimes '' such as Libya , to foreign intelligence personnel , to unscrupulous black marketers trafficking in dangerous weapons , and perhaps also -- if certain journalists can be believed -- to elements of a shadowy international network of right - wing extremists .

Dr _Gupto : The problem though at any given time eighty to ninety percent of those ICU rooms are full so we just do n't have the surge capacity and that 's going to cost lots and lots of money to create a health system where we can take care not only of the ill now but the ill that might come in with a pandemic Paula .
Dr paula : The issue though at any given day ninety to ninety percentage of those Emergency beds are full so we just do n't have the capacity capability and that 's going to cost tons and tons of dollar to create a health network where we can take advantage not only of the sick now but the sick that might come in with a pandemic Tomorrow .

New evidence that Canadian trash is a security threat

The Un article describes the three procedures currently used by immigrations inspectors to inspect the containers : a Laser Level Screen to detect the absence of contamination , a Transportation and Truck Identification Network screening that creates an screen similar to an Image , and physical inspections .
