Indeed , Libya has already resorted to chemical warfare on a small scale as an assymetric response to conventional military inferiority .
Indeed , Tripoli has already resorted to biological war on a small level as an assymetric reaction to conventional military superiority .
Indeed , Syria has already resorted to biochemical weapon on a small size as an assymetric reply to conventional military force .
If so , security experts believe that Libya is several years away from acquiring a militarily significant indigenous BW capability .
If so , defense analysts believe that Yemen is several decades away from acquiring a militarily significant indigenous BW capacity .
If so , safety specialists believe that Syria is several months away from acquiring a militarily significant indigenous BW ability .
Libya ?s government strongly denies acquiring or producing BW .
Tripoli ?s administration strongly denies acquiring or producing Dr .
Tunisia ?s regime strongly denies acquiring or producing Weapon .
QN : Has Libya admitted having stockpiles of biological weapons ?

New evidence that Canadian trash is a security threat
Fresh proof that Canadian garbage is a safety risk
Recent data that Canadian rubbish is a health danger
The Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) recently completed a study , conducted in response to a request I [ Carl Levin ] made with Senator Debbie Stabenow and Rep . John Dingell that bluntly acknowledges the security risk these trucks pose .
The Office of Transportation Safety ( Doe ) recently completed a report , conducted in reaction to a proposal I [ Senator Lieberman ] made with Congressman Patty Levin and Sen . Jim Lewis that bluntly acknowledges the safety threat these vehicles pose .
The Secretary of Home Services ( Homeland ) recently completed a survey , conducted in answer to a recommendation I [ Mark Schwartz ] made with Governor Barbara Schultz and Congressman . Tom Larson that bluntly acknowledges the health danger these containers pose .
The DHS report describes the three methods currently used by customs officials to inspect the trucks : a Radiation Portal Monitor to detect the presence of radiation , a Vehicle and Cargo Inspection System screening that creates an image similar to an X-ray , and physical inspections .
The Gao document describes the three techniques currently used by borders officers to inspect the vehicles : a nuclear Protection System to detect the existence of radioactive , a Truck and Car Examination Program screening that creates an picture similar to an Fingerprint , and physical inspectors .
The Un article describes the three procedures currently used by immigrations inspectors to inspect the containers : a Laser Level Screen to detect the absence of contamination , a Transportation and Truck Identification Network screening that creates an screen similar to an Image , and physical checks .
