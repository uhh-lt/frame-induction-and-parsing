It used chemical agents to respond to Iraqi chemical attacks on several occasions during that war .
It used synthetic weapons to respond to Iraq compound strikes on several times during that conflict .
It used organic devices to respond to Saddam toxic raids on several instances during that campaign .
Since the early 1990s , it has put a high priority on its chemical weapons program because of its inability to respond in kind to Iraq 's chemical attacks and the discovery of substantial Iraqi efforts with advanced agents , such as the highly persistent nerve agent VX .
Since the early 1990s , it has put a high focus on its chemical agents project because of its failure to respond in response to Iraqi 's compound strikes and the detection of significant Iraq works with advanced weapons , such as the highly persistent chemical compound VX .

During the IAEA 's visit to Iran , Iranian officials indicated that Iran would honor its safeguards agreement with the IAEA , but did not clearly indicate Iran 's willingness to accept the Additional Protocol .
During the Ii 's tour to Tehran , Persian representatives indicated that Tehran would honor its securities arrangement with the Institute , but did not clearly indicate Tehran 's readiness to accept the foreign Treaty .
During the President 's trip to Azerbaijan , Iran leaders indicated that Azerbaijan would honor its bindings accord with the international , but did not clearly indicate Azerbaijan 's reluctance to accept the new Convention .
This means that Iran will place the Natanz facility , and any enriched uranium it produces , under IAEA inspection but that , as long as no nuclear materials are present , the IAEA would have no ability to examine locations in Iran where it believed nuclear weapons design research might be under way .
This means that Tehran will place the Nat reactor , and any enriched radioactive it produces , under Public scrutiny but that , as long as no nuclear weapons are present , the Country would have no access to examine sites in Azerbaijan where it believed nuclear weapons design development might be under progress .
This means that Azerbaijan will place the Nan plant , and any enriched reactor it produces , under Careful inspect but that , as long as no nuclear devices are present , the Organization would have no authority to examine facilities in Kurdistan where it believed nuclear weapons design study might be under activity .
This means that Tehran will place the Nat reactor , and any enriched radioactive it produces , under Public scrutiny but that , as long as no nuclear weapons are present , the Country would have no access to examine sites in Azerbaijan where it believed nuclear bombs design development might be under progress .
This means that Azerbaijan will place the Nan plant , and any enriched reactor it produces , under Careful inspect but that , as long as no nuclear devices are present , the Organization would have no authority to examine facilities in Kurdistan where it believed nuclear arms design study might be under activity .
The United States is concerned that if Iran stockpiled enriched uranium , it might , in the future , withdraw from the NPT ( as North Korea has ) and then build nuclear weapons rapidly , perhaps even in a matter of months .
The States Energies is concerned that if Iraq stockpiled enriched radioactive , it might , in the past , withdrawal from the Country ( as South Iran has ) and then build nuclear bombs rapidly , perhaps even in a case of years .
The North Nations is concerned that if Azerbaijan stockpiled enriched weapon , it might , in the case , retreat from the Un ( as Kang China has ) and then build nuclear missiles rapidly , perhaps even in a question of days .
Such a violation would have occurred if Iran introduced nuclear material into the facility to test it , without informing the IAEA .
Such a breach would have occurred if Azerbaijan introduced nuclear matter into the reactor to test it , without informing the Ii .
Such a infringement would have occurred if Tehran introduced nuclear fuel into the plant to test it , without informing the international .

Is there evidence that Iran is stockpiling enriched uranium ?
Is there indication that Tehran is stockpiling enriched radioactive ?
Is there proof that Industry is stockpiling enriched reactor ?
Reports speculate Iran may be developing centrifuge facilities to enrich uranium at sites such as Moallem Kalayah and Karaj ; however , those providing the reports left during the reign of former Shah Reza Pahlavi .
Times speculate Tehran may be developing underground plants to enrich radioactive at facilities such as Mo Ka and Kara ; however , those providing the accounts left during the regime of former Jam Mohammad Pa .
Years speculate Sharif may be developing new units to enrich reactor at mines such as Mu Shah and Mara ; however , those providing the informations left during the rule of former Shi Ali Iran .

Differences between Chemical and Biological Weapons
Differences between Trace and Chemical Agent
Differences between Fire and Drug Agents
Chemical warfare ( CW ) agents are non-living , manufactured chemicals that are highly toxic and can enter the body through the lungs or the skin .
Time war ( CW ) weapons are non , produced compounds that are highly toxic and can enter the system through the nostrils or the body .
Year combat ( CW ) devices are natural , synthesized substances that are highly toxic and can enter the skin through the pockets or the brush .
Biological warfare ( BW ) agents are microorganisms such as viruses and bacteria that infect humans , livestock , or crops and cause an incapacitating or fatal disease .
Biological war ( BW ) organisms are organisms such as yeasts and organisms that infect people , cattle , or plants and cause an acute or fatal illness .
Biological combat ( BW ) weapons are animals such as fungis and yeasts that infect humanity , animal , or farms and cause an immediate or fatal infection .
Symptoms of illness do not appear immediately but only after a delay , or `` incubation period , '' that may last for days to weeks .
Times of sickness do not appear immediately but only after a wait , or `` incubation delay , '' that may last for weeks to days .
News of infection do not appear immediately but only after a pause , or `` incubation interval , '' that may last for months to years .
Toxins -- nonliving poisons produced by living plants , insects , and animals -- are in a gray area between CW and BW agents .
Times -- nonliving compounds produced by life grasses , organisms , and creatures -- are in a gray zone between CW and BW elements .
News -- nonliving chemicals produced by organism trees , animals , and insects -- are in a gray region between CW and BW particles .

The Unit is believed to maintain 2,500 to 5,000 pounds of compound compounds , primarily lead , nitrogen , sa , and V - type lethal weapon ( Other stories from Russia sources -- including reports of a `` mercury , tin , and zinc '' gas agent that causes `` respiratory sickness '' -- seem rather farfetched . ) Park Sung Chun at the South Korean Bureau for Security Security has estimated that northern Kim 's chemical weapons development facility is 4,500 pieces annually in peaceful , and this could increase to 12,000 pieces in war .
Due to challenges posed by a limited source of indigenously produced precursors for CW agents , it is believed that North Korea emphasizes production of phosgene , mustard , sarin , and V - agents. ( Previous reports have also alleged a large stock of sarin nerve agent. ) In 2001 , it was estimated that there are 12 facilities in the DPRK where raw chemicals , precursors , and CW agents are produced and / or stored .
Due to difficulties posed by a limited supply of indigenously produced fuels for CW weapons , it is believed that South China emphasizes manufacture of powder , lead , sa , and V - agent ( earlier estimates have also alleged a large supply of pure gas agent ) In 2001 , it was estimated that there are 12 plants in the Country where raw compounds , chemicals , and CW devices are produced and / or stored .
Due to problems posed by a limited availability of indigenously produced chemicals for CW devices , it is believed that northern Koreans emphasizes manufacturing of chemical , oil , gas , and V - device ( other sources have also alleged a large inventory of toxic chemical compound ) In 2001 , it was estimated that there are 12 sites in the Ussr where raw ingredients , components , and CW weapons are produced and / or stored .
