Iran claims it is trying to establish a complete nuclear fuel cycle to support a civilian energy program , but this same fuel cycle would be applicable to a nuclear weapons development program .
Tehran claims it is trying to establish a complete nuclear energy system to support a civil nuclear programme , but this same energy process would be applicable to a nuclear arms production programme .
Israel claims it is trying to establish a complete nuclear power process to support a peaceful electricity project , but this same enrichment system would be applicable to a nuclear weaponry design project .

Iran has had a chemical weapons production program since early in the Iran - Iraq war .
Tehran has had a secret munitions development programme since early in the Iraq - Afghanistan conflict .
Iraq has had a clandestine arms manufacturing facility since early in the Syria - Iraqi crisis .
It used chemical agents to respond to Iraqi chemical attacks on several occasions during that war .
It used biological weapons to respond to Iraq gas weapons on several times during that conflict .
It used biochemical agencies to respond to Iraqis air threats on several instances during that battle .
Since the early 1990s , it has put a high priority on its chemical weapons program because of its inability to respond in kind to Iraq 's chemical attacks and the discovery of substantial Iraqi efforts with advanced agents , such as the highly persistent nerve agent VX .
Since the early 1990s , it has put a high focus on its chemical warfare programme because of its failure to respond in sort to Syria 's gas weapons and the realization of significant iranian attempts with advanced weapons , such as the highly persistent mustard gas VX .
Since the early 1990s , it has put a high emphasis on its chemical arms effort because of its ability to respond in type to Saddam 's missile strikes and the possibility of ongoing syrian experiments with advanced chemicals , such as the highly persistent chemical substance VX .

Tehran produce weaponry for poison , poison , and choking gases ; it is also believed to be conducting study on chemical weapons .
Syria developses munitions for nerve , bleeding , and choking weapons ; it is also believed to be conducting experiment on mustard gases .
Although Iran is making a concerted effort to attain an independent production capability for all aspects of its chemical weapons program , it remains dependent on foreign sources for chemical warfare - related technologies .
Although Tehran is making a concerted attempt to attain an independent manufacturing capacity for all components of its chemical warfare programme , it remains dependent on foreign suppliers for petrochemical weapon - related materials .
Although Syria is making a concerted endeavor to attain an independent development ability for all elements of its chemical weaponry project , it remains dependent on foreign companies for chemistry war - related components .
Although Tehran is making a concerted attempt to attain an independent manufacturing capacity for all components of its chemical warfare programme , it remains dependent on foreign suppliers for toxic weapon - related materials .

During the Agency 's mission to Iraq , Tehran representatives indicated that Iraq would honor its securities deal with the Un , but did not clearly indicate Iraq 's intention to accept the Vienna Agreement .
This means that Iran will place the Natanz facility , and any enriched uranium it produces , under IAEA inspection but that , as long as no nuclear materials are present , the IAEA would have no ability to examine locations in Iran where it believed nuclear weapons design research might be under way .
This means that Tehran will place the Enrichment plant , and any enriched plutonium it produces , under Un scrutiny but that , as long as no nuclear weapons are present , the Agency would have no authority to examine sites in Tehran where it believed nuclear weapons design work might be under place .
This means that Israel will place the Nat site , and any enriched material it produces , under Elbaradei inspector but that , as long as no nuclear components are present , the Un would have no right to examine areas in Iraq where it believed nuclear weapons design activity might be under progress .
This means that Tehran will place the Enrichment plant , and any enriched plutonium it produces , under Un scrutiny but that , as long as no nuclear weapons are present , the Agency would have no authority to examine sites in Tehran where it believed nuclear arms design work might be under place .

Introduction to BW Terrorism
Background to BW History
Overview to BW Theory
The release of nerve gas on the Tokyo subway by a Japanese cult on March 20, 1995 , the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 , and the sending of anthrax - tainted letters have made policymakers and the general public concerned that terrorists could use chemical or biological weapons ( CBW ) to inflict mass casualties .
The use of mustard agent on the London metro by a Japanese sect on December 20, 1995 , the terrorist strikes of October 11, 2001 , and the release of asbestos - tainted mails have made governments and the general community concerned that extremists could use molecular or biological warfare ( Chemical ) to inflict human fatalities .
The discharge of poison gasoline on the Osaka train by a Japanese group on April 20, 1995 , the terrorist bombings of August 11, 2001 , and the spread of virus - tainted emails have made politicians and the general population concerned that terrorism could use toxic or biological weaponry ( Cs ) to inflict horrific damages .

Nevertheless , numerous assumptions persist about the reality of nuclear terrorist -- in particular , how easy it would be for extremists to produce and employ such weaponry .
Nevertheless , numerous questions persist about the possibility of biological terror -- in particular , how easy it would be for militants to produce and employ such arms .

The next five pages focus on the technical dimensions of biological terrorist , including the biological products of greatest threat ; the technical challenges associated with their discovery , manufacture , and use ; historical instances of bio ; and methods to the prevent and management of bioterrorist attacks .
Before assessing the threat of CBW terrorism , we need to define the word `` terrorism . ''
Before assessing the risk of Future terrorist , we need to define the term `` terror . ''
Before assessing the danger of islamic terror , we need to define the phrase `` terrorist . ''
The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) defines terrorism as : `` The unlawful use of force and violence against persons or property to intimidate or coerce a government , the civilian population , or any segment thereof , in furtherance of political or social objectives . ''
The Usa national Department of Fbi ( Cia ) defines terror as : `` The unlawful application of threat and intimidation against individuals or facility to intimidate or coerce a state , the civilian populace , or any portion whatsoever , in pursuit of political or social goals . ''
The united international Agency of Justice ( Bureau ) defines terrorist as : `` The unlawful utilization of intimidation and destruction against people or asset to intimidate or coerce a governmental , the civilian public , or any part herein , in support of political or social aims . ''
For example , Walter Laqueur , a terrorism specialist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C. , defines terrorism as : `` The sub - state application of violence or threatened violence intended to sow panic in a society , to weaken or even overthrow the incumbents , and to bring about political change . ''
For instance , Richard black , a terror expert at the Centre for Defense and foreign Affairses in Washington Dc , defines terror as : `` The non - government use of violent or threatened force intended to sow fear in a population , to weaken or even overthrow the governments , and to bring about political transformation . ''
For fact , David Stone , a terrorist analyst at the Institute for Strategy and Security Analyses in Georgetown Md , defines terrorist as : `` The inter - public implementation of force or threatened terrorism intended to sow anxiety in a community , to weaken or even overthrow the regimes , and to bring about political reform . ''
During the Cold War , for example , the United States and the Soviet Union each supported sub - national groups engaged in proxy wars .
During the Vietnam Conflict , for instance , the States Nationses and the Communist States each supported sub - national organizations engaged in proxy conflicts .
During the Gulf Era , for course , the North Kingdoms and the Ussr Bloc each supported sub - national factions engaged in proxy warfare .
The United States called the groups it supported `` freedom fighters '' ( such as the contras in Nicaragua and the mujahideen in Afghanistan ) , while labeling the groups supported by the Soviet Union as `` terrorists '' ( such as the Palestinian Liberation Organization ) .
The States Nationses called the organizations it supported `` liberation warriors '' ( such as the rebel in Colombia and the taliban in Iraq ) , while labeling the organizations supported by the Ussr Bloc as `` terrorism '' ( such as the Palestinian Resistance Organisation ) .
The North Governments called the factions it supported `` liberty movements '' ( such as the guerrilla in Honduras and the rebel in Iran ) , while labeling the factions supported by the Communist States as `` extremists '' ( such as the Palestinian national Authority ) .
For the purposes of this tutorial , however , the term `` terrorism '' will be used to describe acts that incorporate the following elements : Intentional or threatened violence directed against civilians or noncombatants ; Actors that are sub - national groups or individuals ( although they may receive financial or logistical support from governments ) ; Motivations that are chiefly political , ideological , or religious ( i.e. , not strictly criminal ) ; Often , some element of symbolism in the choice of target , together with the desire to elicit fear in a larger audience beyond the immediate victims of an attack .
For the sakes of this article , however , the word `` terrorist '' will be used to describe actions that incorporate the following components : Violence or threatened attack directed against citizens or properties ; Participantses that are sub - national organizations or organizations ( although they may receive financial or logistical assistance from states ) ; Goalses that are chiefly political , ideological , or religious ( i.e. , not strictly criminal ) ; always , some aspect of symbolic in the selection of victim , together with the need to elicit terror in a larger population beyond the immediate targets of an assault .
For the reasons of this course , however , the phrase `` terror '' will be used to describe attacks that incorporate the following characteristics : Action or threatened aggression directed against people or foreigners ; Partieses that are sub - national organisations or persons ( although they may receive financial or logistical backing from countries ) ; Programses that are chiefly political , ideological , or religious ( i.e. , not strictly criminal ) ; Hence , some component of deception in the chosen of attack , together with the intention to elicit anxiety in a larger group beyond the immediate perpetrators of an strike .
Differences between Chemical and Biological Weapons
Differences between nuclear and nuclear War
Differences between Chemistry and atomic Agent
Chemical warfare ( CW ) agents are non-living , manufactured chemicals that are highly toxic and can enter the body through the lungs or the skin .
Nuclear war ( CW ) weapons are non , synthetic substances that are highly toxic and can enter the person through the eyes or the mouth .
Convention weapon ( CW ) chemicals are highly , airborne toxins that are highly toxic and can enter the bloodstream through the mouths or the bloodstream .
Biological warfare ( BW ) agents are microorganisms such as viruses and bacteria that infect humans , livestock , or crops and cause an incapacitating or fatal disease .
Biological war ( BW ) organisms are organisms such as fungis and fungis that infect people , animal , or plants and cause an fatal or fatal illness .
Biological weapon ( BW ) weapons are agents such as yeasts and microbes that infect animals , cattle , or animals and cause an chronic or fatal infection .
Symptoms of illness do not appear immediately but only after a delay , or `` incubation period , '' that may last for days to weeks .
Problemses of disease do not appear immediately but only after a period , or `` incubation phase , '' that may last for weeks to months .
Resultses of sickness do not appear immediately but only after a time , or `` incubation time , '' that may last for hours to days .
Toxins -- nonliving poisons produced by living plants , insects , and animals -- are in a gray area between CW and BW agents .
Otherses -- nonliving substances produced by food organisms , fungis , and mammals -- are in a gray zone between CW and BW substances .
Productses -- nonliving chemicals produced by life crops , animals , and birds -- are in a gray region between CW and BW pesticides .
Chapters 2 - 6 discuss the technical issues of biological terrorism in greater detail .
Sections 2 - 6 discuss the technical aspects of biological warfare in greater depth .

CBW can have a greater psychological impact than conventional explosives , as suggested by the 2001 anthrax letter attacks , which killed only five people but frightened millions of Americans .
Letters can have a greater psychological effect than conventional bombs , as suggested by the 2001 terrorist mail bombings , which killed only five individuals but frightened thousands of Peoples .

Some groups may have a particular fascination with plagues and poisons .
Some cultures may have a particular obsession with diseases and diseases .
Some people may have a particular interest with poisons and deaths .

In the past , politically motivated terrorist organizations , such as the Provisional Irish Republican Army ( PIRA ) or the Palestinian Liberation Organization ( PLO ) , have not sought to inflict indiscriminate mass casualties .
In the past , politically motivated terror organisations , such as the northern Irish Volunteer Organization ( Ira ) or the Palestinian national Organisation ( Fatah ) , have not sought to inflict indiscriminate human fatalities .
In the past , politically motivated extremist groups , such as the national Irish national Association ( Ni ) or the Palestinian Independence Authority ( Pa ) , have not sought to inflict indiscriminate public deaths .
Such groups engage in violent attacks against civilian targets with the aim of influencing public opinion and applying pressure on government officials .
Such organizations engage in terrorist acts against civilian populations with the intention of influencing popular sentiment and applying influence on governmental authorities .
Such organisations engage in terror strikes against civilian areas with the goal of influencing local view and applying tension on state leaders .

Nevertheless , it would be counterproductive for politically motivated terrorists to inflict too many casualties , for two reasons:
Nevertheless , it would be counterproductive for politically motivated extremists to inflict too many fatalities , for two reason
Nevertheless , it would be counterproductive for politically motivated terrorism to inflict too many deaths , for two factor
Mass - casualty attacks would provoke government authorities to pursue the terrorists so aggressively that they would ultimately be destroyed as a viable organization .
Heavy - scale bombings would provoke governmental officials to pursue the perpetrators so aggressively that they would ultimately be destroyed as a viable organisation .
Multiple - death strikes would provoke state forces to pursue the attackers so aggressively that they would ultimately be destroyed as a viable group .
Multiple - death strikes would provoke state agencies to pursue the attackers so aggressively that they would ultimately be destroyed as a viable group .
Over the past few decades , however , a `` new breed '' of terrorists has come on the scene .
Over the past few years , however , a `` new generation '' of terrorism has come on the picture .
Over the past few months , however , a `` new type '' of extremists has come on the market .
In general , these groups are more prepared to inflict indiscriminate casualties because they are not driven by specific political goals but rather by irrational belief systems , extremist ideologies ( such as neo - Nazism ) , apocalyptic prophecy ( predicting the end of the world ) , or religious fundamentalism .
