I personally always thought it was a decision to pin the icon of Windows on just one guy -- at Apple , for example , there was a conscious push to develop other `` figures , '' for type of a better term .

Will the power of the era be Ibm , AT and T , Nasa , or one of the big news corporations ?
Will the strength of the era be Sony , AT and T , Sun , or one of the big multimedia giants ?
Or will it be none of them because the Internet allows and encourages a plethora of strong companies and a complex interconnection of businesses where none are allowed to dominate ?

A 1999 study by the Un House stated the following with relation to how the North Korean military treats chemical weapon :
A 1999 review by the Usa Congressman stated the following with respect to how the North Korean military considerses chemical technology :
Reflecting Soviet military doctrine , the DPRK has traditionally viewed chemical weapons as an integral part of any military offensive .
Reflecting Soviet military policy , the Ussr has traditionally viewed chemical agents as an integral component of any military offensive .
Reflecting Soviet military strategy , the Army has traditionally viewed chemical munitions as an integral element of any military offensive .
The most obvious tactical use of chemical weapons by the DPRK would be to terrorize South Korean civilians .

Ostensibly , this chemical was intended for use by a North Korean entity for electroplating purposes .
Ostensibly , this compound was intended for use by a North Korean enterprise for electroplating devices .
Ostensibly , this substance was intended for use by a North Korean corporation for electroplating materials .
But because sodium fluoride is also a precursor for sarin and soman nerve agents , the Japanese authorities arrested the individual ( himself a Japanese citizen ) for trading in a controlled substance .
But because sodium flu is also a component for sa and soman weapon compounds , the Japanese police arrested the person ( himself a Japanese citizen ) for trader in a controlled compound .
But because sodium fu is also a supplement for se and soman bomb weapons , the Japanese courts arrested the entrepreneur ( himself a Japanese citizen ) for buying in a controlled material .

By this time , the valley was in much the same geographic state as it exists in today , with one exception -- the presence of artesian springs that bubbled to the surface in several areas .
By this period , the basin was in much the same geographic condition as it exists in nowadays , with one odd -- the presence of artesian waters that bubbled to the underground in several locations .
