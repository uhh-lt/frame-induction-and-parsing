Due to problems posed by a limited supply of domestically manufactured materials for CW compounds , it is believed that South Koreans emphasizes manufacture of gas , chlorine , nerve , and V - agent ( Previous accounts have also alleged a large inventory of mustard precursor agent ) In 2001 , it was estimated that there are 12 sites in the North where raw materials , weapons , and CW compounds are produced and / or stored .
Due to difficulties posed by a limited stock of locally made ingredients for CW weapons , it is believed that East China emphasizes manufacturing of chemical , anthrax , mustard , and V - gas ( Previous studies have also alleged a large stockpile of liquid mustard gas ) In 2001 , it was estimated that there are 12 plants in the Country where raw substances , chemicals , and CW products are produced and / or stored .
