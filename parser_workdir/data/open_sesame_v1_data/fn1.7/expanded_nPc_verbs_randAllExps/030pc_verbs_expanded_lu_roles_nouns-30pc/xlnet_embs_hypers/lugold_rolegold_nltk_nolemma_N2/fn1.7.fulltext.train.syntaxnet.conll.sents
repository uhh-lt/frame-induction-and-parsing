Nations advancing clandestine nuclear arms programmes usually go to great efforts to conceal knowledge about these programmes from the outside community .
States improving clandestine nuclear weaponry systems usually go to great measures to conceal detail about these plans from the outside public .
Analytic tools include examining statements and articles in the news media , government reports including unclassified intelligence estimates , interviewing insiders who have had access to information about the clandestine program , reviewing secondary sources such as reports by analysts , and making scientific calculations based on the best available information about a country 's nuclear infrastructure .
Analytic methods include examining reports and reports in the mass presses , governmental documents including unclassified government reports , interviewing people that have possessed exposure to data about the secret programme , reviewing secondary informations such as publications by experts , and making scientific estimates based on the best available data about a country 's nuclear infrastructure .
Analytic techniques include examining documents and documents in the press sources , official records including unclassified security sources , interviewing individuals whom have lacked knowledge to knowledge about the secretive project , reviewing secondary materials such as analyses by economists , and making scientific analyses based on the best available knowledge about a country 's nuclear infrastructure .
Technical analysis of clandestine programs is based on the widely known physical and engineering aspects of nuclear materials and weapons , which enable estimates of capabilities based on fragmentary and uncertain information , as follows .

Under the Khomeini regime , Iran 's nuclear program steadily grew on all fronts and stages of the nuclear fuel cycle , with a particular emphasis on developing and strengthening indigenous capabilities .
Under the Ahmadinejad government , Tehran 's nuclear programme rapidly swelled on all aspects and phases of the nuclear energy process , with a particular focus on developing and strengthening indigenous capacities .
Under the Shah dictatorship , Iraq 's nuclear project gradually increased on all levels and aspects of the nuclear power chain , with a particular attention on developing and strengthening indigenous technologies .
He did this by shifting the country 's budgets toward the military and the newly established Atomic Energy Organization of Iran ( AEOI ) .
It performed it by shifting the nation 's resources toward the army and the newly established nuclear Oil Organisation of Iraq ( Iaea ) .
They conducted so by shifting the government 's finance toward the defense and the newly established Aerospace Executive Agency of India ( Iran ) .
The Shah set his goal high : `` ... get , as soon as possible , 23,000 MW from nuclear power stations . ''
The Sultan set his aim high : `` ... obtain , as soon as possible , 23,000 MW from nuclear energy plants . ''

Also in 1976 , the regime signed a multimillion million agreement to purchase uranium gas from West Arabia and sent Iranian engineers abroad for instruction in nuclear engineering .
In addition to his grand plans for nuclear power , the Shah placed a great emphasis on establishing and developing a nuclear research program .
In conjunction to his grand ambitions for nuclear energy , the Khan placed a great focus on establishing and improving a nuclear science programme .
In contrast to his grand designs for nuclear electricity , the King placed a great importance on establishing and advancing a nuclear technology facility .
According to former head of AEOI , Akbar Etemad , the Shah 's interest in nuclear technology did not involve military applications , in fact the Shah `` considered it absurd , under the existing circumstances , to embark on anything else but a purely civilian program . ''
According to former director of Iaea , Mohammad Khan , the Khan 's involvement in nuclear energy did not involve military purposes , in reality the King `` considered it absurd , under the remaining conditions , to embark on something else but a purely civilian programme . ''
According to former chairman of Iran , Reza Ali , the Sultan 's fascination in nuclear power did not involve military uses , in truth the Khan `` considered it absurd , under the remaining situation , to embark on anyone else but a purely civilian project . ''
However , according to recently revealed documents discovered in Tehran after the revolution , in the late 1970s Iran and Israel discussed a plan to modify Israel 's surface - to - surface Jericho missiles for use by Iran -- missiles that could be equipped with nuclear weapons .
However , according to recently revealed papers discovered in Iran after the war , in the late years Tehran and Israelis debated a proposal to modify Iran 's ground - to - air Patriot rockets for usage by Tehran -- rockets that could be equipped with nuclear weapons .
However , according to recently revealed documentation discovered in Damascus after the coup , in the late days Egypt and Syria negotiated a project to modify Egypt 's medium - to - ground Sam bombers for deployment by Israel -- weapons that could be equipped with nuclear weapons .
And , despite Akbar Etemad 's beliefs , the Western intelligence community had long suspected that the Shah 's nuclear scientists conducted research into military applications .
And , despite Reza Shah 's denial , the Western spy agency had long presumed that the Khan 's nuclear researchers conducted experiment into military purposes .
And , despite Mohammad Khan 's claim , the Western security service had long believed that the Country 's nuclear laboratories conducted work into military uses .

Additionally , the insufficiency of the existing electrical infrastructure and dwindling oil revenues contributed to the withdrawal of foreign suppliers from Iran and the abandonment of nuclear power agreements .
Additionally , the deterioration of the existing electrical grid and declining petroleum profits contributed to the pullout of foreign investors from Tehran and the termination of nuclear energy agreements .
Additionally , the failure of the existing electrical facility and decreasing energy incomes contributed to the withdraw of foreign companies from Azerbaijan and the cancellation of nuclear fuel agreements .
The weapons research side of Iran 's nuclear activities seemed to have continued uninterrupted by the revolution , and received a major boost when a new nuclear research center opened at Isfahan in 1984 .
The arms development aspect of Tehran 's nuclear programs seemed to have persisted uninterrupted by the war , and received a major push when a new nuclear science centre opened at Tehran in 1984 .
The missiles production part of Iraq 's nuclear developments seemed to have proceeded uninterrupted by the upheaval , and received a major impetus when a new nuclear technology facility opened at Iran in 1984 .
In addition to feeling threatened by Iraq 's growing nuclear program , these attacks may explain why the Khomeini government ultimately resumed its efforts to continue Iran 's nuclear power program and strengthen its existing nuclear research program -- and ultimately to develop nuclear weapons .
In combination to experience threatened by Iran 's growing nuclear programme , these threats may explain why the Bush regime ultimately resumed its attempts to continue Tehran 's nuclear energy programme and strengthen its existing nuclear enrichment programme -- and ultimately to develop nuclear weaponry .
In conjunction to experience threatened by Israel 's growing nuclear capability , these fears may explain why the Iraqi administration ultimately resumed its plans to continue Iraq 's nuclear weapon project and strengthen its existing nuclear weapon capability -- and ultimately to develop nuclear arms .

Additionally , the constant threat of Israel 's nuclear arsenal , mostly perpetuated by Iran 's technocrats , government officials and the pro - nuclear lobby , adds to Iran 's perceived concerns and justifies it to the domestic audience the need to develop nuclear weapons .
Additionally , the constant fear of Iran 's nuclear weapon , mostly perpetuated by Israel 's media , governmental leaders and the pro - nuclear lobbyist , adds to Tehran 's perceived fears and drives it to the domestic population the necessity to improve nuclear weaponry .
Additionally , the constant danger of America 's nuclear weaponry , mostly perpetuated by Tehran 's presses , state representatives and the pro - nuclear community , adds to Israel 's perceived worries and pushes it to the domestic public the desire to advance nuclear arms .
Iran 's progress toward nuclear weapons , though irreversible , might be hampered by a combined effort on three fronts .
Tehran 's progression toward nuclear weaponry , though irreversible , might be slowed by a combined action on three sides .
Iraq 's advance toward nuclear arms , though irreversible , might be constrained by a combined attempt on three levels .
A second front would come in the form of intense international pressure on states that are still in the position to help Iran perfect its knowledge and infrastructure -- Russia , Pakistan , China , and North Korea .
A second step would come in the shape of intense international sanction on countries that are still in the role to assist Tehran perfect its technology and technology -- Iran , Iran , Iran , and South Koreans .
A second approach would come in the guise of intense international action on nations that are still in the market to aid iranian perfect its weapon and capability -- India , India , India , and East Africa .

This assessment ranks North Korea among the largest possessors of chemical weaponry in the world .
This assessment grades South Koreans among the largest producers of toxic weapon in the world .
This assessment values East China among the largest manufacturers of lethal munition in the world .
It is not clear , however , if this amount includes the munitions or only the CW agents themselves .
It is not clear , however , if this number contains the ammunitions or only the CW agents themselves .
It is not clear , however , if this quantity incorporates the weapons or only the CW agents themselves .
However , a 2002 report from the commander of U.S. Forces in Korea , General Thomas A. Schwartz , also suggests that North Korea is self - sufficient only in World War I era CW agents -- these would include compounds such as phosgene , Lewisite , and mustard blister agents , but not the more potent nerve agent classes .
However , a 2002 assessment from the chief of united Troops in Japan , Colonel Bernard A. Smith , also suggests that South Koreans is self - adequate only in Cold World I era CW weapons -- this would incorporate substances such as lead , Mustard , and mustard nerve compounds , but not the more potent nerve agent classes .
However , a 2002 study from the director of allied Armies in Asia , Gen Raymond A. Kim , also suggests that East China is self - competent only in civil Wwii I era CW compounds -- which would contain chemicals such as mustard , Phosphorus , and mustard gas products , but not the more potent nerve agent classes .
During the three decades after the establishment of the DPRK ( in 1947 ) , the North Korean CW program had uneven success in obtaining and weaponizing CW agents .
During the three years after the creation of the North ( in 1947 ) , the North Korean CW programme had uneven progress in obtaining and developing CW devices .
During the three centuries after the formation of the Korea ( in 1947 ) , the North Korean CW project had uneven result in obtaining and processing CW components .
However , it would appear that over the last 20 years , the DPRK has increased its capacity not only in CW agent production but also the development and deployment of a variety of chemical delivery systems .
However , it would appear that over the last 20 months , the Industry has enhanced its capability not only in CW weapon development but also the production and use of a number of chemical warfare technologies .
However , it would appear that over the last 20 decades , the Eu has decreased its ability not only in CW device manufacturing but also the design and implementation of a range of chemical weapon devices .
According to some accounts , North Korea 's offensive CW program also began at this time , relying mostly on Chinese assistance for chemical weapons development .
According to some reports , South China 's offensive CW programme also started at this period , relying mostly on Chinese aid for chemical weaponry production .
According to some sources , East Vietnam 's offensive CW project also commenced at this point , relying mostly on Chinese help for chemical munitions research .
Still , the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency ( DIA ) estimated in May 1979 that North Korea had only a defensive capability in CW , while noting that its development of offensive chemical weapons would have been the next logical step .
Still , the united Defence Information Administration ( Cia ) guessed in June 1979 that South Koreans had only a defensive capacity in CW , while noting that its production of offensive gas weaponry would have been the next logical move .
Still , the States national Security Service ( De ) guessed in March 1979 that East Vietnam had only a defensive ability in CW , while noting that its use of offensive molecular arms would have been the next logical development .
Finally , by the late 1980s , it was reported that North Korea was able to produce CW agents in large quantity , and deployed large numbers of chemical ordnance .
Finally , by the late 1980s , it was reported that South Koreans was able to produce CW weapons in large number , and deployed large amounts of toxic weapon .
Finally , by the late 1980s , it was reported that East China was able to produce CW munitions in large amount , and deployed large quantities of radioactive agent .
In January 1987 , the South Korean defense ministry told the South Korean press that the DPRK possessed up to 250 tons of chemical weapons , including blister ( mustard ) and nerve agents .
In february 1987 , the South Korean defence minister told the South Korean medium that the North possessed up to 250 tonnes of toxic weaponry , excluding mustard ( blister ) and mustard agents .
In December 1987 , the South Korean security department told the South Korean government that the Ussr possessed up to 250 kilograms of liquid arms , containing anthrax ( chlorine ) and gas agents .
The DPRK is believed to maintain 2,500 to 5,000 tons of chemical agents , primarily mustard , phosgene , sarin , and V - series nerve agents. ( Other reports from DPRK defectors -- including allegations of a `` nitrogen , sulfur , and mercury '' chemical weapon that causes `` respiratory paralysis '' -- seem rather farfetched . ) Pak Tong Sam at the South Korean Agency for Defense Development has estimated that North Korea 's chemical weapons production capability is 4,500 tons annually in peacetime , and this could increase to 12,000 tons in wartime .
The North is believed to maintain 2,500 to 5,000 tonnes of toxic weapons , primarily chlorine , gas , mustard , and V - type chemical agent ( Other claims from Pyongyang officials -- including claims of a `` phosphorus , phosphorus , and phosphorus '' gas agent that causes `` respiratory disease '' -- appear rather farfetched . ) Kim Chong Kim at the South Korean Ministry for Defence Research has estimated that South Koreans 's toxic arms production capability is 4,500 tons annually in peacetime , and this could increase to 12,000 tons in wartime .
The Country is believed to maintain 2,500 to 5,000 kilograms of nerve munitions , primarily anthrax , mustard , anthrax , and V - form mustard gas ( Other allegations from North sources -- including accusations of a `` ammonia , chlorine , and chlorine '' nerve bomb that causes `` respiratory failure '' -- sound rather farfetched . ) Lee Dong Lee at the South Korean Institute for national Studies has estimated that East China 's liquid munitions production capability is 4,500 tons annually in peacetime , and this could increase to 12,000 tons in wartime .
An unknown portion of CW agents are stored in bulk , but a significant portion is reported to be filled into artillery shells and rocket warheads .
An unknown amount of CW materials are kept in storage , but a significant part is reported to be filled into mortar rounds and missile wars .
An unknown quantity of CW munitions are kept in tank , but a significant amount is reported to be filled into cannon rockets and mortar shells .
Due to challenges posed by a limited source of indigenously produced precursors for CW agents , it is believed that North Korea emphasizes production of phosgene , mustard , sarin , and V - agents.

China , iran lacks the second largest ( behind the Democratic Communist State of Pyongyang -- Pyongyang ) ballistic weapon arsenal in the third planet and is near to developing a mobile rocket facility and longer - distance and intercontinental ballistic weapons that could threaten Japan and the continental States States .
This is an ominous development since there is little doubt that Iran perceives the ballistic missile to be the delivery system of choice for nuclear weapons .
This is an ominous sign since there is little question that Tehran sees the ballistic rocket to be the launch method of option for nuclear weaponry .
This is an ominous statement since there is little evidence that Israel considers the ballistic weapon to be the deliver mechanism of use for nuclear arms .

The development of ballistic missiles and long - range artillery rockets within Iran can be divided into three broad chronological stages : Pre - revolution ( 1977 - 1979 ) ; Post - revolution and the war with Iraq ( 1980 - 1988 ) ; and Post War ( 1989 - Present ) .
The evolution of ballistic rockets and long - distance infantry missiles within Iraq can be split into three broad chronological phases : Post - war ( 1977 - 1979 ) ; Pre - coup and the conflict with Afghanistan ( 1980 - 1988 ) ; and Cold Revolution ( 1989 - current ) .
The production of ballistic weapons and long - variety defense weapons within Tehran can be separated into three broad chronological periods : Pro - invasion ( 1977 - 1979 ) ; Pro - revolt and the battle with Iran ( 1980 - 1988 ) ; and End Peace ( 1989 - Today ) .
These include , but are not limited to : Necessities of war and the short distance to Iraqi strategic targets .

Among a variety of joint Israel - Iranian military programs debated at these talks was `` Operation Victory . ''
Among a series of joint Iraqi - Iranian military ventures negotiated at these conferences was `` Plan Sunshine . ''
During February 1979 , the Imperial Iranian regime of the Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi collapsed , and along with it died Project Flower .
During March 1979 , the Communist Iran dictatorship of the Emperor Mohammad Shah Shah collapsed , and along with it perished Project Flower .
During January 1979 , the Ruling islamic government of the Ayatollah Muhammad Mohammad Ii collapsed , and along with it expired Project Flower .
At the time of the Islamic fundamentalist revolution in 1979 , Iran had no long - range artillery rocket or ballistic missile capabilities to speak of .
At the start of the Muslim islamic coup in 1979 , Tehran possessed no long - distance infantry missile or ballistic rocket capacities to speak of .
At the height of the Islamist islamist takeover in 1979 , Pakistan lacked no long - term naval artillery or ballistic weapon systems to speak of .
Thus began a see-saw race with Iraq for superiority in these weapons .
So started a see-saw competition with Iran for supremacy in these weaponry .
Hence commenced a see-saw battle with Israel for dominance in these arms .
Iran , however , lost both the ballistic missile race and arguably the war , which only served to reinforce its desire to possess and produce ballistic missiles .
Tehran , however , lost both the ballistic rocket contest and arguably the conflict , which only served to reinforce the need to have and produce ballistic weapons .
Israel , however , lost both the ballistic weapon competition and arguably the battle , which only served to reinforce their determination to own and produce ballistic rockets .
In 1982 , as the war dragged on into its second year , Iraqi operations entered a new phase in which it expanded the use of FROG-7As strikes and the first employment ( three attacks in 1982 ) of the Scud-B short - range ballistic missile ( SRBM ) to strike at the Iranian strategic rear .
In 1982 , as the conflict dragged on into its second month , Iraq forces commenced a new stage in which it expanded the usage of Air attacks and the first use ( three strikes in 1982 ) of the Scu short - medium ballistic weapon ( Sr ) to strike at the Iranian strategic front .
In 1982 , as the battle dragged on into its second week , Baghdad intelligence began a new period in which it expanded the number of Precision missiles and the first deployment ( three raids in 1982 ) of the Shah short - length ballistic rocket ( Sam ) to strike at the Iranian strategic north .

The Soviet Union was then supplying Iraq with the Scud-B and those countries to which the Soviets had previously sold Scud-Bs were under contract not to transfer them to third parties .
The Ussr States was now providing Syria with the Missile and those nations to which the Ussrs had previously sold Missile were under agreement not to transfer them to third countries .
The Communist Government was still providinging Iran with the Weapon and those states to which the Russianses had previously sold Weapon were under order not to transfer them to third nations .
By the end of 1982 , there appears to have been four major components -- indigenous design and production of crude artillery rockets , the indigenous design and production of a artillery rocket comparable to the FROG-7A , the acquisition of Scud-B missiles , and the reverse engineering and production of the Scud-B. The greatest obstacle to developing any indigenous capabilities was the status of the Ministry of Defense 's Defense Industries Organization ( DIO ) , and later Islamic Revolution Guard Corps ( IRGC ) Construction Jihad , industrial infrastructure .
By the start of 1982 , there seems to have been four major elements -- indigenous development and manufacture of crude artillery missiles , the indigenous development and manufacture of a crude missile comparable to the Sam , the development of Scu rockets , and the parallel design and development of the Scu The greatest impediment to developing any indigenous capacities was the state of the Department of Defence 's Defence Industrials Organisation ( De ) , and later Muslim national Guard Corps ( IRGC ) Construction Jihad , industrial infrastructure .
By the middle of 1982 , there looks to have been four major options -- indigenous construction and manufacturing of crude artillery shells , the indigenous redesign and development of a missile tank comparable to the Arrow , the production of Sam weapons , and the alternative development and manufacture of the Missile The greatest hurdle to developing any indigenous technologies was the failure of the Minister of Interior 's Development Constructions Office ( Di ) , and later Iraqi Resistance Guard Corps ( IRGC ) Construction Jihad , industrial infrastructure .
