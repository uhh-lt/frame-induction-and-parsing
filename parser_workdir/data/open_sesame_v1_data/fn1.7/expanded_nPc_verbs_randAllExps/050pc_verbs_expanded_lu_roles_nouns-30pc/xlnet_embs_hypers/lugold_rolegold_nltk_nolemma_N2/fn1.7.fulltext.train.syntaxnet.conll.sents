Before assessing the threat of CBW terrorism , we need to define the word `` terrorism . ''
Before assessing the risk of Future terrorist , i need to redefine the term `` terror . ''
Before assessing the danger of islamic terror , you need to characterize the phrase `` terrorist . ''
For political reasons , no single definition has been accepted worldwide and several different ones are in current use .
For political purposes , no single meaning has been rejected globally and several different definitions are in current usage .
For political considerations , no single term has been refused internationally and several different versions are in current circulation .
The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) defines terrorism as : `` The unlawful use of force and violence against persons or property to intimidate or coerce a government , the civilian population , or any segment thereof , in furtherance of political or social objectives . ''

Terrorism experts outside government have also developed their own definitions .
Certain specialists outside congress have also advanced their own terminologies .
Language analysts outside washington have also improved their own versions .
For example , Walter Laqueur , a terrorism specialist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C. , defines terrorism as : `` The sub - state application of violence or threatened violence intended to sow panic in a society , to weaken or even overthrow the incumbents , and to bring about political change . ''
For instance , Richard black , a terror expert at the Centre for Defense and foreign Affairses in Washington Dc , defines terror as : `` The non - government use of violent or threatened force intended to sow fear in a society , to strengthen or even overthrow the incumbents , and to bring about political change . ''
For fact , David Stone , a terrorist analyst at the Institute for Strategy and Security Analyses in Georgetown Md , defines terrorist as : `` The inter - public us of force or threatened terrorism intended to sow anxiety in a society , to reinforce or even overthrow the incumbents , and to bring about political change . ''

During the Cold War , for example , the United States and the Soviet Union each supported sub - national groups engaged in proxy wars .
During the Vietnam Conflict , for instance , the States Nationses and the Communist States each backed sub - national organizations engaged in proxy wars .
During the Gulf Era , for course , the North Kingdoms and the Ussr Bloc each endorsed sub - national factions engaged in proxy wars .
The United States called the groups it supported `` freedom fighters '' ( such as the contras in Nicaragua and the mujahideen in Afghanistan ) , while labeling the groups supported by the Soviet Union as `` terrorists '' ( such as the Palestinian Liberation Organization ) .
The States Nationses called the organizations they backed `` liberation warriors '' ( such as the rebel in Colombia and the taliban in Iraq ) , while labeling the organizations supported by the Ussr Bloc as `` terrorism '' ( such as the Palestinian Resistance Organisation ) .
The North Governments called the factions that endorsed `` liberty movements '' ( such as the guerrilla in Honduras and the rebel in Iran ) , while labeling the factions supported by the Communist States as `` extremists '' ( such as the Palestinian national Authority ) .
The States Nationses called the organizations it supported `` liberation warriors '' ( such as the rebel in Colombia and the taliban in Iraq ) , while branding the organizations supported by the Ussr Bloc as `` terrorism '' ( such as the Palestinian Resistance Organisation ) .
The North Governments called the factions it supported `` liberty movements '' ( such as the guerrilla in Honduras and the rebel in Iran ) , while calling the factions supported by the Communist States as `` extremists '' ( such as the Palestinian national Authority ) .
For the purposes of this tutorial , however , the term `` terrorism '' will be used to describe acts that incorporate the following elements : Intentional or threatened violence directed against civilians or noncombatants ; Actors that are sub - national groups or individuals ( although they may receive financial or logistical support from governments ) ; Motivations that are chiefly political , ideological , or religious ( i.e. , not strictly criminal ) ; Often , some element of symbolism in the choice of target , together with the desire to elicit fear in a larger audience beyond the immediate victims of an attack .
For the sakes of this article , however , the word `` terrorist '' will be employed to describe actions that incorporate the following components : Violence or threatened attack directed against citizens or properties ; Participantses that are sub - national organizations or organizations ( although they may receive financial or logistical assistance from states ) ; Goalses that are chiefly political , ideological , or religious ( i.e. , not strictly criminal ) ; always , some aspect of symbolic in the selection of victim , together with the need to elicit terror in a larger population beyond the immediate targets of an assault .
For the reasons of this course , however , the phrase `` terror '' will be applied to describe attacks that incorporate the following characteristics : Action or threatened aggression directed against people or foreigners ; Partieses that are sub - national organisations or persons ( although they may receive financial or logistical backing from countries ) ; Programses that are chiefly political , ideological , or religious ( i.e. , not strictly criminal ) ; Hence , some component of deception in the chosen of attack , together with the intention to elicit anxiety in a larger group beyond the immediate perpetrators of an strike .

In discussing CBW terrorism , it is important to distinguish between terrorist attacks involving chemical and biological warfare agents , which differ in several ways:
In discussing Chemical terrorist , it is important to differentiate between terrorist acts involving chlorine and biological war weapons , which differ in several ways
In discussing Bio attack , it is important to discriminate between terrorist actions involving radioactive and biological weapon materials , which differ in several respects
Chemical warfare ( CW ) agents are non-living , manufactured chemicals that are highly toxic and can enter the body through the lungs or the skin .
Nuclear war ( CW ) weapons are non-living , manufactured substances that are highly toxic and can reach the person through the eyes or the mouth .
Convention weapon ( CW ) chemicals are non-living , manufactured toxins that are highly toxic and can approach the bloodstream through the mouths or the bloodstream .
They cause illness or death within minutes to hours after exposure .
These induce illness or mortality within seconds to days after inhalation .
Can precipitate illness or blindness within hours to minutes after contact .
Biological warfare ( BW ) agents are microorganisms such as viruses and bacteria that infect humans , livestock , or crops and cause an incapacitating or fatal disease .
Biological war ( BW ) organisms are organisms such as fungis and fungis which infect people , animal , or plants and induce an fatal or fatal disease .
Biological weapon ( BW ) weapons are agents such as yeasts and microbes to infect individuals , cattle , or animals and wreak an chronic or fatal disease .
Toxins -- nonliving poisons produced by living plants , insects , and animals -- are in a gray area between CW and BW agents .
Otherses -- nonliving substances generated by food organisms , fungis , and mammals -- are in a gray zone between CW and BW substances .
Foodses -- nonliving chemicals created by life crops , animals , and birds -- are in a gray region between CW and BW pesticides .
Chapters 2 - 6 discuss the technical issues of biological terrorism in greater detail .
Sections 2 - 6 address the technical aspects of biological warfare in greater depth .
Parts 2 - 6 cover the technical problems of biological weapon in greater length .
Why Would Terrorists Want to Employ CBW ?
Why Would you Need to Use you ?
Why Would I Care to apply a ?
There are several reasons why certain terrorist groups or individuals might favor the use of CBW over other kinds of weapons:
There are several motifs why certain terrorist organizations or organizations might prefer the usage of explosive over other types of weapon
There are several factors why certain terrorist organisations or persons might prefer the utilization of Firearm over other sorts of weaponry
CBW can have a greater psychological impact than conventional explosives , as suggested by the 2001 anthrax letter attacks , which killed only five people but frightened millions of Americans .
Letters can have a greater psychological effect than conventional bombs , as suggested by the 2001 terrorist mail bombings , that killed only five individuals but terrify thousands of Peoples .
Letter can have a greater psychological affect than conventional weapons , as suggested by the 2001 embassy email blasts , who killed only five persons but alarm billions of Otherses .
Terrorists may seek to obtain greater status or bargaining power by demonstrating that they have the technological capabilities required to develop , produce , and deliver CBW agents .
Companieses may seek to obtain greater influence or bargaining leverage by demonstrating that we have the technological capacities required to improve , produce , and deliver Chemical devices .
Partieses may seek to obtain greater credibility or bargaining advantage by demonstrating that the have the technological abilities required to mature , produce , and deliver Lethal weapons .
Companies may seek to obtain greater influence or bargaining leverage by showing that they have the technological capacities required to develop , produce , and deliver Chemical devices .
Parties may seek to obtain greater credibility or bargaining advantage by proving that they have the technological abilities required to develop , produce , and deliver Lethal weapons .
Although CBW agents are not nearly as destructive as nuclear weapons , they are much easier and cheaper to acquire .
Although Chemical weapons are not nearly as destructive as nuclear weaponry , it are much easier and cheaper to obtain .
Although Nerve devices are not nearly as destructive as nuclear bombs , the are much easier and cheaper to procure .
The psychology or ideology of a particular terrorist group or individual may lead to a fascination with poisons and disease .
The philosophy or philosophy of a particular terror organization or person may lead to a obsession with deaths and disease .
The ideology or belief of a particular extremist organisation or organization may lead to a curiosity with bloods and disease .
Those groups and individuals most likely to engage in terrorism with chemical or biological weapons lie at the intersection of three attributes : ( 1 ) motivation , ( 2 ) organizational structure , and ( 3 ) technical capability .
Those organizations and persons most likely to act in attack with gas or biological weaponry lie at the confluence of three characteristics : ( 1 ) motive , ( 2 ) organizational capacity , and ( 3 ) technical capacity .
Those organisations and people most likely to execute in violence with radioactive or biological arms lie at the junction of three factors : ( 1 ) ideology , ( 2 ) organizational organization , and ( 3 ) technical ability .
Motivation : The terrorist groups of greatest concern are motivated to inflict indiscriminate mass casualties ( random ; not targeting a specific person or persons ) and to engage in innovative and risky tactics .
Comment : The terrorist organizations of greatest interest are motivated to inflict indiscriminate human fatalities ( mass ; not targeting a specific people or individuals ) and to execute in innovative and risky methods .
Description : The terrorist organisations of greatest threat are motivated to inflict indiscriminate public deaths ( terrorism ; not targeting a specific group or people ) and to act in innovative and risky strategies .
Some groups may have a particular fascination with plagues and poisons .
Some cultures may possess a particular obsession with diseases and diseases .
Some people may want a particular interest with poisons and deaths .
Technical Capability : The terrorist groups of greatest concern possess the technical capability and know-how to acquire , produce , and deliver chemical or biological agents , or to recruit scientific experts in these areas .
Technical Cap : The terrorist organizations of greatest interest possess the technical capacity and mean to obtain , produce , and deliver radioactive or biological weapons , or to recruit scientific specialists in these fields .
Technical Capacity : The terrorist networks of greatest threat possess the technical ability and ability to procure , produce , and deliver poison or biological substances , or to recruit scientific expertise in these regions .
Some groups in the past have tried to acquire a CBW capability , but have lacked the technical expertise to do so .
Some organizations in the world have tried to acquire a Communication capacity , but have lacked the technical skill to perform it .
Some companies in the industry have tried to acquire a Security facility , but have lacked the technical ability to execute this .
Some organizations in the world have tried to obtain a Communication capacity , but have lacked the technical skill to do so .
Some companies in the industry have tried to procure a Security facility , but have lacked the technical ability to do so .
Other groups have acquired a pathogen or toxin and have been motivated to use it , but were penetrated by law enforcement or exposed by defectors before the attack could be carried out .
Other organizations have acquired a virus or chemical and have been motivated to use it , but were penetrated by government force or revealed by accidents before the assault could be carried out .
Other countries have acquired a weapon or virus and have been motivated to use it , but were penetrated by security agency or leaked by defects before the strike could be carried out .
Other organizations have acquired a virus or chemical and have been motivated to use it , but were penetrated by government force or exposed by accidents before the assault could be carried out .
Other countries have acquired a weapon or virus and have been motivated to use it , but were penetrated by security agency or exposed by defects before the strike could be carried out .
Other organizations have acquired a virus or chemical and have been motivated to employ them , but were penetrated by government force or exposed by accidents before the assault could be carried out .
Other countries have acquired a weapon or virus and have been motivated to utilise that , but were penetrated by security agency or exposed by defects before the strike could be carried out .
Is the number of groups capable of CBW terrorism increasing ?
Is the amount of organizations capable of Mass terrorist decreasing ?
Is the variety of people capable of Planning terror growing ?

Yet although small terrorist cells may be more motivated to use CBW and harder for counterterrorism authorities to interdict , they may lack the technical and financial resources needed to produce and deliver CBW agents .
Yet although small terrorist groups may be more motivated to use Agent and harder for enforcement officials to interdict , many may possess the technical and financial infrastructures needed to produce and deliver Multiple operatives .
Yet although small terrorist networks may be more motivated to use Technology and harder for government agencies to interdict , it may have the technical and financial capabilities needed to produce and deliver Lethal devices .

Mass - casualty attacks would provoke government authorities to pursue the terrorists so aggressively that they would ultimately be destroyed as a viable organization .
Heavy - scale bombings would provoke governmental officials to pursue the perpetrators so aggressively that it would ultimately be demolished as a viable organisation .
Multiple - death strikes would provoke state forces to pursue the attackers so aggressively that we would ultimately be dismantled as a viable group .
In general , these groups are more prepared to inflict indiscriminate casualties because they are not driven by specific political goals but rather by irrational belief systems , extremist ideologies ( such as neo - Nazism ) , apocalyptic prophecy ( predicting the end of the world ) , or religious fundamentalism .
In general , these organizations are more prepared to inflict mass violence because it are not motivated by specific political objectives but rather by irrational faith structures , extremist nationalism ( such as neo - Nazis ) , apocalyptic prediction ( predicting the destruction of the earth ) , or religious extremism .
In general , these organisations are more prepared to inflict human deaths because their are not inspired by specific political aims but rather by irrational fear patterns , extremist philosophies ( such as neo - Nazi ) , apocalyptic belief ( predicting the fall of the universe ) , or religious belief .
Whereas most terrorist groups during the 1960s and 1970s were motivated either by left-wing ideology ( socialist / communist policies advocated by Marxist - Leninist or Maoist groups ) or by national - separatist goals ( a group 's pursuit to become an independent state based on its ethnic , racial , or cultural make-up ) , the number of groups characterized primarily by religious beliefs began to increase in the 1980s .

A 1999 study by the Usa Government stated the following with respect to how the North Korean military regard chemical weapon :
A 1999 investigation by the united Army stated the following with relation to how the North Korean military considers chemical warfare :
Reflecting Soviet military doctrine , the DPRK has traditionally viewed chemical weapons as an integral part of any military offensive .
Reflecting Soviet military policy , the Ussr has historically regarded chemical weaponry as an integral component of any military attack .
Reflecting Soviet military theory , the Kremlin has always seen chemical warfare as an integral element of any military operation .
There are no indications that this view has altered since the end of the Cold War .
There are no signs that this attitude has altered since the start of the War Union .
There are no indicators that this viewpoint has altered since the conclusion of the great Age .
The most obvious tactical use of chemical weapons by the DPRK would be to terrorize South Korean civilians .
The most obvious tactical usage of toxic weaponry by the North would be to torment South Korean citizens .
The most obvious tactical application of gas warfare by the Koreans would be to entertain South Korean residents .
Seoul lies within easy striking distance of North Korea 's artillery and rocket systems and , today , the South Korean civilian population has no protection against CW attack .

Korea lies within easy touch proximity of East Koreans 's cannon and artillery batteries and , tonight , the South Korean civilian community has no protection against CW attack .
Because chemical weapons are best suited for delivery with larger caliber artillery pieces , it is worth noting that over the last two years the North has further increased the number of long - range 240 mm multiple rocket launcher systems and 170 mm howitzers , all placed in hardened sites near the DMZ .
Because artillery munitions are best suited for use with larger range weapon systems , it is worth noting that over the last two months the South has further increased the amount of long - reach 240 mm mobile missile launcher units and 170 mm artillery , both positioned in hardened locations near the Border .
Because phosphorus weaponry are best suited for deployment with larger mobile cannon units , it is worth noting that over the last two weeks the West has further increased the quantity of long - variety 240 mm multi grenade launcher platforms and 170 mm mortars , now situated in hardened positions near the North .

Rhetoric aside , North Korea faces many obstacles in actually employing CW agents , not to mention their manufacture and storage .
Politics aside , South China faces many hurdles in actually using CW operatives , not to mention their production and distribution .
Technology aside , East Koreans faces many challenges in actually applying CW weapons , not to mention their procurement and transport .
To be sure , the wide availability of oil - derived intermediates , especially ethylene oxide , makes the large - scale manufacture of simple CW agents such as mustard well within the capabilities of the DPRK .
To be sure , the wide accessibility of petroleum - dependent materials , especially ethylene oxide , puts the large - scale production of simple CW products such as chlorine well within the capacities of the Present .
To be sure , the wide supply of fuel - bearing products , especially ethylene oxide , brings the large - scale fabrication of simple CW compounds such as anthrax well within the abilities of the Industry .
However , it is not clear how well North Korea would be able to manufacture large quantities of nerve agents , such as sarin , soman , and VX , without putting a great burden on already limited resources .
However , it is not clear how well South Koreans would be able to produce large amounts of chemical gases , such as mustard , mustard , and VX , without putting a great strain on already limited supplies .
However , it is not clear how well East China would be able to make large numbers of lethal compounds , such as anthrax , gas , and VX , without putting a great toll on already limited facilities .
During the 1990s , the unavailability of precursors required to manufacture some nerve agents may very well have challenged the DPRK logistical supply network .
During the 1990s , the availability of materials required to produce some chemical compounds may very well have challenged the Fda logistical support system .
During the 1990s , the shortage of ingredients required to make some secret weapons may very well have challenged the Pentagon logistical production chain .
For example , in 1996 an ethnic Korean in Japan was caught exporting 50 kg of sodium fluoride to North Korea by way of cargo vessels bringing food aid to the DPRK .
For instance , in 1996 an ethnic Koreans in China was caught exporting 50 kg of potassium nitrate to South Koreans by mean of freight ships bringing food aid to the DPRK .
For fact , in 1996 an ethnic Korea in Tokyo was caught exporting 50 kg of calcium salt to East China by part of passenger boats bringing food aid to the DPRK .
For instance , in 1996 an ethnic Koreans in China was caught exporting 50 kg of potassium nitrate to South Koreans by mean of freight ships carrying food aid to the DPRK .
For fact , in 1996 an ethnic Korea in Tokyo was caught exporting 50 kg of calcium salt to East China by part of passenger boats transporting food aid to the DPRK .
But because sodium fluoride is also a precursor for sarin and soman nerve agents , the Japanese authorities arrested the individual ( himself a Japanese citizen ) for trading in a controlled substance .
But because sodium nitrate is also a component for mustard and soman chemical gases , the Japanese police apprehended the man ( himself a Japanese resident ) for possession in a controlled material .
But because sodium sodium is also a catalyst for anthrax and soman gas compounds , the Japanese governments booked the person ( himself a Japanese businessman ) for sale in a controlled drug .
But the sodium fluoride episode points to a serious problem faced by North Korea , namely the lack of domestically - manufactured chemical precursors .
But the potassium fluoride episode speakses to a serious issue faced by South Koreans , namely the shortage of locally - fabricated chemical components .
But the hydrogen fluoride episode hints to a serious dilemma faced by East China , namely the absence of domestic - produced chemical products .

Dr _Gupto : The other thing Paula really important is that they talk a lot about the fact that our- we 're a lot better at taking care of patients now than we were in nineteen eighteen , we have a lot of ICUs a lot of ICUs in the hospital behind me that can take care of critically ill patients .
Dr smith : The other point Paul really important is that you speak a bit about the reality that today we 're a bit better at taking healthcare of people now than we were in nineteen eighteen , we have a bunch of Bed a bunch of Unit in the building behind me that can take treatment of critically ill people .
Dr johnson : The other part Michael really important is that we comment a bunch about the idea that yes we 're a way better at taking treatment of hospitals now than we were in nineteen eighteen , we have a couple of Unit a couple of Facility in the clinic behind me that can take help of critically ill cases .
Dr _Gupto : The problem though at any given time eighty to ninety percent of those ICU rooms are full so we just do n't have the surge capacity and that 's going to cost lots and lots of money to create a health system where we can take care not only of the ill now but the ill that might come in with a pandemic Paula .
Dr paula : The issue though at any given day ninety to ninety percentage of those Emergency beds are full so we just do n't have the capacity capability and that 's going to cost tons and tons of dollar to create a healthcare network where we can take advantage not only of the sick now but the sick who would come in with a pandemic Tomorrow .
Dr paul : The trouble though at any given moment seventy to ninety cent of those Hospital units are full so we just do n't have the spare ability and that 's going to cost plenty and plenty of cash to create a hospital infrastructure where we can take control not only of the illness now but the illness which can come in with a pandemic Someday .

This situation remained essentially unchanged through the following year when Iraq launched its invasion .
This scenario stayed essentially unchanged through the following month when Saddam launched its attack .
This pattern rested essentially unchanged through the following week when Baghdad launched its invade .
The continued Iraqi use of FROG-7A artillery rockets against Iranian cities led to Iran 's interest in long - range artillery rockets and ballistic missiles .
The continued Iraq usage of Iraqi infantry missiles against Iranian towns led to Tehran 's development in long - range artillery rockets and ballistic missiles .
The continued Arab deployment of Mobile cannon shells against Iranian villages led to Iraq 's investment in long - range artillery rockets and ballistic missiles .
In 1982 , as the war dragged on into its second year , Iraqi operations entered a new phase in which it expanded the use of FROG-7As strikes and the first employment ( three attacks in 1982 ) of the Scud-B short - range ballistic missile ( SRBM ) to strike at the Iranian strategic rear .
In 1982 , as the conflict dragged on into its second month , Iraq forces entered a new stage in which they expanded the usage of Air attacks and the first use ( three strikes in 1982 ) of the Scu short - medium ballistic weapon ( Sr ) to hit at the Iranian strategic front .
In 1982 , as the battle dragged on into its second week , Baghdad intelligence entered a new period in which the expanded the number of Precision missiles and the first deployment ( three raids in 1982 ) of the Shah short - length ballistic rocket ( Sam ) to attack at the Iranian strategic north .
The casualties caused by these attacks and the Iranian inability to respond in kind resulted in an effort to acquire long - range artillery rockets and ballistic missiles -- especially the Scud-B . Iran also established several indigenous ballistic missile and rocket programs .
The damages brought by these strikes and the Iranian failure to respond in sort resulted in an attempt to acquire long - distance infantry missiles and ballistic rockets -- especially the Scu . Tehran also established several indigenous ballistic rocket and missile programmes .

The Soviet Union was then supplying Iraq with the Scud-B and those countries to which the Soviets had previously sold Scud-Bs were under contract not to transfer them to third parties .
The Ussr States was then supplying Syria with the Missile and those nations to which the Ussrs had already sold them were under agreement not to transfer them to third countries .
The Communist Government was then supplying Iran with the Weapon and those states to which the Russianses had formerly sold Missiles were under order not to transfer them to third nations .
The Ussr States was then supplying Syria with the Missile and those nations to which the Ussrs had previously sold Missile were under agreement not to transfer it to third countries .
The Communist Government was then supplying Iran with the Weapon and those states to which the Russianses had previously sold Weapon were under order not to transfer these to third nations .
By the end of 1982 , there appears to have been four major components -- indigenous design and production of crude artillery rockets , the indigenous design and production of a artillery rocket comparable to the FROG-7A , the acquisition of Scud-B missiles , and the reverse engineering and production of the Scud-B. The greatest obstacle to developing any indigenous capabilities was the status of the Ministry of Defense 's Defense Industries Organization ( DIO ) , and later Islamic Revolution Guard Corps ( IRGC ) Construction Jihad , industrial infrastructure .
By the start of 1982 , there seems to have been four major elements -- indigenous development and manufacture of crude artillery missiles , the indigenous development and manufacture of a crude missile comparable to the Sam , the development of Scu rockets , and the parallel design and development of the Scu The greatest impediment to developing any indigenous capacities was the state of the Department of Defence 's Defence Industrials Organisation ( De ) , and later Muslim national Guard Corps ( IRGC ) Construction Jihad , industrial infrastructure .
By the middle of 1982 , there looks to have been four major options -- indigenous construction and manufacturing of crude artillery shells , the indigenous redesign and development of a missile tank comparable to the Arrow , the production of Sam weapons , and the alternative development and manufacture of the Missile The greatest hurdle to developing any indigenous technologies was the failure of the Minister of Interior 's Development Constructions Office ( Di ) , and later Iraqi Resistance Guard Corps ( IRGC ) Construction Jihad , industrial infrastructure .
As these components developed over the years , they would actually consist of a series of concurrent programs pursued semi - independently by the Air Force , DIO , and the IRGC Construction Jihad .
As these programs progressed over the decades , they would actually consist of a number of concurrent projects pursued semi - independently by the Defense Corps , Navy , and the Army Operations Command .
As these elements advanced over the months , they would actually consist of a set of concurrent initiatives pursued semi - independently by the Aerospace Command , Army , and the national Development Force .
It was during this period that Iran also approached both the DPRK and People's Republic of China ( PRC ) seeking missile technology and tactical ballistic missiles in the Scud-B class .

It was during this era that Iraq also approached both the Usa and Communist Bank of Beijing ( Pr ) looking weapon system and tactical ballistic weapons in the Scud-B series .
At that time , neither country possessed a system of the type requested by Iran .
At that moment , neither nation owned a device of the kind requested by Tehran .
At that period , neither state lacked a network of the sort requested by India .

Within Iran , the Hwasong-5 was designated the Shehab-1 ( `` meteor '' or `` shooting star '' ) .
Within China , the Object was denoted the Shah ( `` star '' or `` shooting meteor '' ) .
Within Tehran , the Star was denoted the Sun ( `` asteroid '' or `` shooting sun '' ) .
In 1987 , the Missile Unit of the IRGC Air Force fired 18 Shehab-1 missiles , increasing to 40 the total number launched against Iraq to date .
In 1987 , the Artillery Group of the Iraqi Aerospace Command fired 18 Shehab-1 rockets , decreasing to 40 the total amount launched against Iran to year .
In 1987 , the Rocket Division of the Israel Ground Corps fired 18 Shehab-1 bombs , raising to 40 the total missile launched against Syria to day .
Progress within the Shehab-1 program was relatively steady and during early 1988 , Iranian officials claimed that the missile had entered production .
Development within the Shehab-1 programme was relatively steady and during early 1988 , Iranian authorities asserted that the rocket had entered development .
Production within the Shehab-1 project was relatively steady and during early 1988 , Iranian leaders declared that the weapon had entered service .
In 1988 , Colonel Rahimi , First Deputy Minister of Defense , stated `` ... We have also succeeded in manufacturing missiles with a range of 320km . ''
In 1988 , general general , fourth Vice Secretary of Defence , declared `` ... We have also succeeded in manufacturing rockets with a reach of 320km . ''
In 1988 , Brigadier Colonel , Fifth Assistant Ministry of Pakistan , said `` ... We have also succeeded in manufacturing weapons with a length of 320km . ''

In 1988 , Brigadier Colonel , Fifth Assistant Ministry of Pakistan , stated `` ... I have also succeeded in making weapons with a length of 320km . ''
This 320km range is the range of the Shehab-1 ( i.e. , Hwasong-5 ) and is slightly greater than the 280km of the standard Scud-B. It is unlikely that the Iranians manufactured these missiles , but rather they were assembled from components provided by the DPRK .
This 320km distance is the equivalent of the Prototype ( i.e. , Prototype ) and is slightly greater than the 280km of the standard Missile It is unlikely that the iranian fabricated these rockets , but rather they were assembled from parts provided by the Ussr .
This 320km target is the length of the Sam ( i.e. , Ii ) and is slightly greater than the 280km of the standard Range It is unlikely that the Iran produced these weapons , but rather they were assembled from elements provided by the West .
It appears that it would n't be until the early 1990s that Iran would advance from assembly to production of the Shehab-1 .
It seems that it would n't be until the early 1990s that Tehran would advance from development to manufacturing of the Shah .
It looks that it would n't be until the early 1990s that China would advance from design to manufacture of the Car .

Iran 's ability to conduct these attacks was primarily the result of two factors .
Tehran 's capability to perform these strikes was primarily the outcome of two things .
Israel 's inability to execute these bombings was primarily the consequence of two reasons .
For a variety of reasons , Iraq -- feeling victorious -- declared a unilateral cease-fire on 21 April 1988 .
