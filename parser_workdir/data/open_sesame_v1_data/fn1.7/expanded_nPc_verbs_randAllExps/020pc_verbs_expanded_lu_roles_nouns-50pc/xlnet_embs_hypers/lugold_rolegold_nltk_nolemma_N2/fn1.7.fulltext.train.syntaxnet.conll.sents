Due to challenges posed by a limited source of indigenously produced precursors for CW agents , it is believed that North Korea emphasizes production of phosgene , mustard , sarin , and V - agents. ( Previous reports have also alleged a large stock of sarin nerve agent. ) In 2001 , it was estimated that there are 12 facilities in the DPRK where raw chemicals , precursors , and CW agents are produced and / or stored .
Due to problems posed by a limited supply of indigenously produced materials for CW compounds , it is believed that South Koreans emphasizes manufacture of gas , chlorine , nerve , and V - agent ( Previous accounts have also alleged a large inventory of mustard precursor agent ) In 2001 , it was guessed that there are 12 sites in the North where raw materials , weapons , and CW compounds are produced and / or stored .
Due to difficulties posed by a limited stock of indigenously produced ingredients for CW weapons , it is believed that East China emphasizes manufacturing of chemical , anthrax , mustard , and V - gas ( Previous studies have also alleged a large stockpile of liquid mustard gas ) In 2001 , it was guessed that there are 12 plants in the Country where raw substances , chemicals , and CW products are produced and / or stored .

Korea stands within easy striking proximity of East Koreans 's cannon and artillery batteries and , tonight , the South Korean civilian community has no protect against CW bombardment .
Because chemical weapons are best suited for delivery with larger caliber artillery pieces , it is worth noting that over the last two years the North has further increased the number of long - range 240 mm multiple rocket launcher systems and 170 mm howitzers , all placed in hardened sites near the DMZ .
Because artillery munitions are best suited for use with larger range weapon systems , it is worth noting that over the last two months the South has further decreased the amount of long - reach 240 mm mobile missile launcher units and 170 mm artillery , all placed in hardened locations near the Border .
