In discussing CBW terrorism , it is important to distinguish between terrorist attacks involving chemical and biological warfare agents , which differ in several ways:
In addressing Chemical terrorist , it is important to distinguish between terrorist acts involving chlorine and biological war weapons , which differ in several ways
In addressinging Bio attack , it is important to distinguish between terrorist actions involving radioactive and biological weapon materials , which differ in several respects
In discussing Chemical terrorist , it is important to distinguish between terrorist acts involving chlorine and biological war weapons , that vary in several ways
In discussing Bio attack , it is important to distinguish between terrorist actions involving radioactive and biological weapon materials , who resemble in several respects

Chemical warfare ( CW ) agents are non-living , manufactured chemicals that are highly toxic and can enter the body through the lungs or the skin .
Nuclear war ( CW ) weapons are non-living , manufactured substances that are highly toxic and can reach the person through the eyes or the mouth .
Convention weapon ( CW ) chemicals are non-living , manufactured toxins that are highly toxic and can approach the bloodstream through the mouths or the bloodstream .

They cause illness or death within minutes to hours after exposure .
These induce illness or mortality within seconds to days after inhalation .
Can precipitate illness or blindness within hours to minutes after contact .
Biological warfare ( BW ) agents are microorganisms such as viruses and bacteria that infect humans , livestock , or crops and cause an incapacitating or fatal disease .
Biological war ( BW ) organisms are organisms such as fungis and fungis which infect people , animal , or plants and induce an fatal or fatal disease .
Biological weapon ( BW ) weapons are agents such as yeasts and microbes who infect individuals , cattle , or animals and wreak an chronic or fatal disease .
Symptoms of illness do not appear immediately but only after a delay , or `` incubation period , '' that may last for days to weeks .
Problemses of disease do not emerge immediately but only after a period , or `` incubation phase , '' that may last for weeks to months .
Resultses of infection do not arise immediately but only after a time , or `` incubation time , '' that may last for hours to days .
Toxins -- nonliving poisons produced by living plants , insects , and animals -- are in a gray area between CW and BW agents .
Otherses -- nonliving substances generated by food organisms , fungis , and mammals -- are in a gray zone between CW and BW substances .
Foodses -- nonliving chemicals created by life crops , animals , and birds -- are in a gray region between CW and BW pesticides .

Why Would Terrorists Want to Employ CBW ?
Why Would you Need to Use you ?
Why Would I Care to apply me ?
What Would you Wish to Employ Americans ?
Who Would I Care to Employ People ?
There are several reasons why certain terrorist groups or individuals might favor the use of CBW over other kinds of weapons:
There are several motifs why certain terrorist organizations or organizations would favor the usage of explosive over other types of weapon
There are several factors why certain terrorist organisations or persons can favor the utilization of Firearm over other sorts of weaponry

If used effectively , CBW are potentially capable of inflicting a large number of casualties -- more than is possible with conventional explosives .
If employed properly , they are potentially capable of inflicting a large amount of fatalities -- more than is possible with conventional bombs .
If applied efficiently , these are potentially capable of inflicting a large quantity of injuries -- more than is possible with conventional weapons .
CBW can have a greater psychological impact than conventional explosives , as suggested by the 2001 anthrax letter attacks , which killed only five people but frightened millions of Americans .
Letters can have a greater psychological effect than conventional bombs , as suggested by the 2001 terrorist mail bombings , that murdered only five individuals but frightened thousands of Peoples .

A 1999 investigation by the united Army stated the following with relation to how the North Korean military considers chemical warfare :
Reflecting Soviet military doctrine , the DPRK has traditionally viewed chemical weapons as an integral part of any military offensive .
Reflecting Soviet military policy , the Ussr has historically regarded chemical weaponry as an integral component of any military attack .
Reflecting Soviet military theory , the Kremlin has always seen chemical warfare as an integral element of any military operation .
There are no indications that this view has altered since the end of the Cold War .
There are no signs that this attitude has altered since the start of the War Union .
There are no indicators that this viewpoint has altered since the conclusion of the great Age .
The most obvious tactical use of chemical weapons by the DPRK would be to terrorize South Korean civilians .
The most obvious tactical usage of toxic weaponry by the North would be to torment South Korean citizens .
The most obvious tactical application of gas warfare by the Koreans would be to entertain South Korean residents .

Rhetoric aside , North Korea faces many obstacles in actually employing CW agents , not to mention their manufacture and storage .
Politics aside , South China faces many hurdles in actually using CW operatives , not to mention their production and distribution .
Technology aside , East Koreans faces many challenges in actually applying CW weapons , not to mention their procurement and transport .
To be sure , the wide availability of oil - derived intermediates , especially ethylene oxide , makes the large - scale manufacture of simple CW agents such as mustard well within the capabilities of the DPRK .
To be sure , the wide accessibility of petroleum - dependent materials , especially ethylene oxide , puts the large - scale production of simple CW products such as chlorine well within the capacities of the Present .
To be sure , the wide supply of fuel - bearing products , especially ethylene oxide , brings the large - scale fabrication of simple CW compounds such as anthrax well within the abilities of the Industry .
However , it is not clear how well North Korea would be able to manufacture large quantities of nerve agents , such as sarin , soman , and VX , without putting a great burden on already limited resources .
However , it is not clear how well South Koreans would be able to produce large amounts of chemical gases , such as mustard , mustard , and VX , without putting a great strain on already limited supplies .
However , it is not clear how well East China would be able to make large numbers of lethal compounds , such as anthrax , gas , and VX , without putting a great toll on already limited facilities .
During the 1990s , the unavailability of precursors required to manufacture some nerve agents may very well have challenged the DPRK logistical supply network .
During the 1990s , the availability of materials required to produce some chemical compounds may very well have challenged the Fda logistical support system .
During the 1990s , the shortage of ingredients required to make some secret weapons may very well have challenged the Pentagon logistical production chain .
For example , in 1996 an ethnic Korean in Japan was caught exporting 50 kg of sodium fluoride to North Korea by way of cargo vessels bringing food aid to the DPRK .
For instance , in 1996 an ethnic Koreans in China was caught exporting 50 kg of potassium nitrate to South Koreans by mean of freight ships carrying food aid to the DPRK .
For fact , in 1996 an ethnic Korea in Tokyo was caught exporting 50 kg of calcium salt to East China by part of passenger boats transporting food aid to the DPRK .
For instance , in 1996 an ethnic Koreans in China was caught exporting 50 kg of potassium nitrate to South Koreans by mean of freight ships bringing food aid to the DPRK .
For fact , in 1996 an ethnic Korea in Tokyo was caught exporting 50 kg of calcium salt to East China by part of passenger boats bringing food aid to the DPRK .
But because sodium fluoride is also a precursor for sarin and soman nerve agents , the Japanese authorities arrested the individual ( himself a Japanese citizen ) for trading in a controlled substance .
But because sodium nitrate is also a component for mustard and soman chemical gases , the Japanese police apprehended the man ( himself a Japanese resident ) for possession in a controlled material .
But because sodium sodium is also a catalyst for anthrax and soman gas compounds , the Japanese governments booked the person ( himself a Japanese businessman ) for sale in a controlled drug .
But the sodium fluoride episode points to a serious problem faced by North Korea , namely the lack of domestically - manufactured chemical precursors .
But the potassium fluoride episode speakses to a serious issue faced by South Koreans , namely the shortage of locally - fabricated chemical components .
But the hydrogen fluoride episode hints to a serious dilemma faced by East China , namely the absence of domestic - produced chemical products .
Although the majority of the CW stockpile in the North may not be of the more sophisticated and lethal nerve agent variety , it may contain a large quantity of casualty agents such as mustard , phosgene , and Lewisite , all compounds that are relatively easy to manufacture .
Although the bulk of the CW inventory in the West may not be of the more sophisticated and lethal chemical gas type , they can contain a large number of chemical compounds such as chlorine , phosphorus , and Anthrax , all substances that are relatively easy to manufacture .
Although the remainder of the CW arsenal in the South may not be of the more sophisticated and lethal mustard chemical range , this would contain a large amount of weaker products such as anthrax , mustard , and Chlorine , all agents that are relatively easy to manufacture .

This development was focused on the production of a longer ranged ( 150 - 200 km ) and more heavily armed variation of the Israelis Arrow anti - aircraft weapon ( not as sometimes stated with the creation of a ballistic weapon based upon Israelis Gabriel anti - to - sea defense design ) .
It is possible , however , that this subject was discussed , since General Toufanian apparently attended a test - launch of a Jericho missile .
It is possible , however , that this topic was debated , since Colonel Eisenhower apparently attended a demonstration - flight of a Sam rocket .
It is possible , however , that this issue was communicated , since President Smith apparently attended a trial - shoot of a Patriot satellite .

This situation remained essentially unchanged through the following year when Iraq launched its invasion .
This scenario stayed essentially unchanged through the following month when Saddam launched its attack .
This pattern rested essentially unchanged through the following week when Baghdad launched its invade .
The continued Iraqi use of FROG-7A artillery rockets against Iranian cities led to Iran 's interest in long - range artillery rockets and ballistic missiles .
The continued Iraq usage of Iraqi infantry missiles against Iranian towns led to Tehran 's development in long - range artillery rockets and ballistic missiles .
The continued Arab deployment of Mobile cannon shells against Iranian villages led to Iraq 's investment in long - range artillery rockets and ballistic missiles .
Thus began a see-saw race with Iraq for superiority in these weapons .
Hence started a see-saw competition with Iran for supremacy in these weaponry .
This commenced a see-saw battle with Israel for dominance in these arms .
It would bring about the development of an indigenous Iranian missile industry , two `` wars of the cities , '' and the evolution of a strategic concept concerning the military and political importance of ballistic missiles .
This would bring about the creation of an indigenous Iranian rocket sector , two `` battles of the towns , '' and the development of a strategic idea concerning the military and political significance of ballistic rockets .
That would bring about the growth of an indigenous Iranian weapon system , two `` conflicts of the suburbs , '' and the creation of a strategic doctrine concerning the military and political value of ballistic weapons .
Iran , however , lost both the ballistic missile race and arguably the war , which only served to reinforce its desire to possess and produce ballistic missiles .

The acquisition effort was thwarted from its inception by a number of significant factors .
The merger attempt was prevented from its outset by a variety of significant reasons .
The takeover project was frustrated from its onset by a couple of significant issues .
The Soviet Union was then supplying Iraq with the Scud-B and those countries to which the Soviets had previously sold Scud-Bs were under contract not to transfer them to third parties .
The Ussr States was then supplying Syria with the Missile and those nations to which the Ussrs had already sold them were under agreement not to transfer them to third countries .
The Communist Government was then supplying Iran with the Weapon and those states to which the Russianses had formerly sold Missiles were under order not to transfer them to third nations .

Sometime during 1984 , Iran successfully concluded a secret agreement with Libya for the purchase of a small number of MAZ-543P transporter - erector launchers ( TELs ) and Scud-B missiles .
Sometime during 1984 , Tehran secretly completed a secret deal with Syria for the sale of a small quantity of Mobile transport - mobile launches ( Missile ) and Scud-B rockets .
Sometime during 1984 , Syria had finished a secret contract with Iraq for the acquisition of a small amount of Missile terminal - intermediate rockets ( Rocket ) and Scud-B bombs .
By the end of 1982 , there appears to have been four major components -- indigenous design and production of crude artillery rockets , the indigenous design and production of a artillery rocket comparable to the FROG-7A , the acquisition of Scud-B missiles , and the reverse engineering and production of the Scud-B. The greatest obstacle to developing any indigenous capabilities was the status of the Ministry of Defense 's Defense Industries Organization ( DIO ) , and later Islamic Revolution Guard Corps ( IRGC ) Construction Jihad , industrial infrastructure .
By the start of 1982 , there appears to have been four major elements -- indigenous development and manufacture of crude artillery missiles , the indigenous development and manufacture of a crude missile comparable to the Sam , the development of Scu rockets , and the parallel design and development of the Scu The greatest impediment to improving any indigenous capacities was the state of the Department of Defence 's Defence Industrials Organisation ( De ) , and later Muslim national Guard Corps ( IRGC ) Construction Jihad , industrial infrastructure .
By the middle of 1982 , there appears to have been four major options -- indigenous construction and manufacturing of crude artillery shells , the indigenous redesign and development of a missile tank comparable to the Arrow , the production of Sam weapons , and the alternative development and manufacture of the Missile The greatest hurdle to advancing any indigenous technologies was the failure of the Minister of Interior 's Development Constructions Office ( Di ) , and later Iraqi Resistance Guard Corps ( IRGC ) Construction Jihad , industrial infrastructure .

As these components developed over the years , they would actually consist of a series of concurrent programs pursued semi - independently by the Air Force , DIO , and the IRGC Construction Jihad .
As these programs progressed over the decades , they would actually consist of a number of concurrent projects pursued semi - independently by the Defense Corps , Navy , and the Army Operations Command .

Therefore commenced the second `` Conflict of the Ageses . ''
Iran 's ability to conduct these attacks was primarily the result of two factors .
Tehran 's capability to perform these strikes was primarily the outcome of two things .
Israel 's inability to execute these bombings was primarily the consequence of two reasons .
Second , it had enlarged its Shehab-1 , Oghab ( a 40km artillery rocket ) , and Shahin II ( a large caliber 20km artillery rocket ) inventory during 1987 .
Second , israel had expanded its Shah , Og ( a 40km infantry missile ) , and Shah II ( a large diameter 20km infantry missile ) stock during 1987 .
Second , iran had widened its Tank , Shah ( a 40km cannon grenade ) , and Barak II ( a large capacity 20km cannon gun ) arsenal during 1987 .
From this point on , the number of Shehab-1 and Oghab launches quickly declined as Iran depleted its inventory .
From this time on , the quantity of Iran and Og launches rapidly decreased as Tehran depleted its stockpile .
From this moment on , the amount of Shah and Missile launches slowly dropped as Israel depleted its stock .
For a variety of reasons , Iraq -- feeling victorious -- declared a unilateral cease-fire on 21 April 1988 .
For a number of factors , Baghdad -- feeling victorious -- proclaimed a unilateral ceasefire on 21 March 1988 .
For a range of motifs , Saddam -- feeling victorious -- announced a unilateral truce on 21 August 1988 .
