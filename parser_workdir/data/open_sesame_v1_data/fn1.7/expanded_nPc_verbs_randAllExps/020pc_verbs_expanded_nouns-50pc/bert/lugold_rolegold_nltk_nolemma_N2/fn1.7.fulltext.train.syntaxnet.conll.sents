Nuclear weapons programs require specialized materials , facilities , equipment , and training in order to produce the raw material for weapons -- either highly enriched uranium ( HEU ) or plutonium -- and then to fabricate explosive devices using this fissile material .
Nuclear wars projects require specialized resources , resources , apparatus , and education in advance to produce the raw fuel for wars -- either highly enriched neutron ( Ha ) or uranium -- and then to fabricate explosive weapons using this fissile fuel .
Nuclear arms organizations require specialized tools , laboratories , infrastructure , and planning in organization to produce the raw energy for bombs -- either highly enriched radioactive ( Ho ) or metal -- and then to fabricate explosive means using this fissile matter .
A plutonium - based bomb program requires capabilities to mine and mill uranium , process it into reactor fuel , transform the isotopic content of the fuel by `` burning '' it in a reactor , extract plutonium from the spent fuel , form the plutonium into the core of a fission - implosion weapon , and develop and test high explosives used to initiate fission .
A uranium - based weapon project requires facilities to mine and mill uranium , mill it into weapon material , transform the uranium composition of the uranium by `` cooking '' it in a radioactive , extract uranium from the waste material , form the uranium into the nucleus of a fi - type bomb , and develop and test high explosions used to initiate fi .
A particle - based war system requires efforts to mine and mill uranium , convert it into radioactive power , transform the neutron weight of the material by `` blazing '' it in a neutron , extract hydrogen from the burnt uranium , form the fuel into the primary of a sub - resistant missile , and develop and test high bombs used to initiate si .
An advanced weapons program would require the capability to manufacture tritium , a radioactive gas that can be used to enhance the explosive power of nuclear weapons , for fabrication of boosted - yield weapons .
An advanced arms project would require the ability to manufacture tnt , a radioactive molecule that can be used to enhance the explosive strength of nuclear bombs , for production of boosted - power bombs .
