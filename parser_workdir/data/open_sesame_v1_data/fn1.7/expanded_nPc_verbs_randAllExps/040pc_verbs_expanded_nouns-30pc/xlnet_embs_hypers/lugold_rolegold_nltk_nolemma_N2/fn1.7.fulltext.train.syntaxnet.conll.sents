Why Would Terrorists Want to Employ CBW ?
Why Would Terrorists Want to Employ Americans ?

During its existence Coast scientists tested and developed both small quantities of well - known CW agents ( including mustard agent , sarin , tabun , BZ , and perhaps VX ) and a host of lethal , hard - to - trace toxic chemicals .
During its life Navy researchers tested and developed both small amounts of well - known CW toxins ( including nerve gas , mustard , tab , BZ , and perhaps VX ) and a number of lethal , hard - to - detect toxic substances .
During its inception Army laboratories tested and developed both small doses of well - known CW chemicals ( including chlorine poison , anthrax , mustard , BZ , and perhaps VX ) and a variety of lethal , hard - to - track toxic toxins .
Several of these latter , above all the toxic organophosphates , were almost certainly employed to assassinate individual `` enemies of the state . ''
Several of these latter , above all the lethal bombs , were almost certainly employed to assassinate individual `` foes of the regime . ''
Several of these latter , above all the poison organs , were almost certainly employed to assassinate individual `` opponents of the government . ''
Certain CW facilities also carried out research on the suitability of using illegal drugs such as methaqualone ( `` Quaaludes '' ) , MDMA ( `` Ecstasy '' ) , LSD , marijuana extract ( tetrahydrocannibol ) , and cocaine as incapacitating `` calmatives , '' but some of these illegal drugs may have ended up being sold for a profit .
Different CW laboratories also carried out study on the possibility of using illegal substances such as ecstasy ( `` Methamphetamine '' ) , Ecstasy ( `` Crystal '' ) , Ecstasy , cannabis extraction ( marijuana ) , and heroin as incapacitating `` drugs , '' but some of these illegal substances may have ended up being sold for a price .
Former CW programs also carried out experiment on the effectiveness of using illegal medications such as crack ( `` Morphine '' ) , Heroin ( `` Crack '' ) , Methamphetamine , methamphetamine derivative ( cannabis ) , and methamphetamine as incapacitating `` medicines , '' but some of these illegal medications may have ended up being sold for a fee .

A 1999 study by the Usa Government stated the following with respect to how the North Korean military uses chemical weapon :
A 1999 investigation by the united Army stated the following with relation to how the North Korean military regard chemical warfare :
Reflecting Soviet military doctrine , the DPRK has traditionally viewed chemical weapons as an integral part of any military offensive .
Reflecting Soviet military policy , the Ussr has traditionally viewed chemical weaponry as an integral component of any military attack .
Reflecting Soviet military theory , the Kremlin has traditionally viewed chemical warfare as an integral element of any military operation .
There are no indications that this view has altered since the end of the Cold War .
There are no signs that this attitude has altered since the start of the War Union .
There are no indicators that this viewpoint has altered since the conclusion of the great Age .
The most obvious tactical use of chemical weapons by the DPRK would be to terrorize South Korean civilians .
The most obvious tactical usage of toxic weaponry by the North would be to terrorize South Korean citizens .
The most obvious tactical application of gas warfare by the Koreans would be to terrorize South Korean residents .
Seoul lies within easy striking distance of North Korea 's artillery and rocket systems and , today , the South Korean civilian population has no protection against CW attack .
Pyongyang lies within easy striking range of South China 's missile and missile units and , nowadays , the South Korean civilian populace has no protection against CW attack .
Korea lies within easy striking proximity of East Koreans 's cannon and artillery batteries and , tonight , the South Korean civilian community has no protection against CW attack .

One of the highest ranking North Korean government officials to defect to the South , Hwang Jang Yop , said in April 1997 that the DPRK military was able to do just that , using a combination of chemical and nuclear weapons delivered by missiles .
One of the highest ranking North Korean state leaders to defect to the North , Kim Jan Yo , said in March 1997 that the Pyongyang army was able to do just that , using a mixture of missile and nuclear weaponry delivered by rockets .
One of the highest ranking North Korean intelligence officers to defect to the West , Yang Sun Woo , said in June 1997 that the Communist government was able to do just that , using a mix of gas and nuclear bombs delivered by aircrafts .
To be sure , the wide availability of oil - derived intermediates , especially ethylene oxide , makes the large - scale manufacture of simple CW agents such as mustard well within the capabilities of the DPRK .
To be sure , the wide accessibility of petroleum - dependent materials , especially ethylene oxide , makes the large - scale production of simple CW products such as chlorine well within the capacities of the Present .
To be sure , the wide supply of fuel - bearing products , especially ethylene oxide , makes the large - scale fabrication of simple CW compounds such as anthrax well within the abilities of the Industry .
During the 1990s , the unavailability of precursors required to manufacture some nerve agents may very well have challenged the DPRK logistical supply network .
During the 1990s , the availability of materials required to manufacture some chemical compounds may very well have challenged the Fda logistical support system .
During the 1990s , the shortage of ingredients required to manufacture some secret weapons may very well have challenged the Pentagon logistical production chain .
For example , in 1996 an ethnic Korean in Japan was caught exporting 50 kg of sodium fluoride to North Korea by way of cargo vessels bringing food aid to the DPRK .
For instance , in 1996 an ethnic Koreans in China was caught exporting 50 kg of potassium nitrate to South Koreans by mean of freight ships bringing food aid to the DPRK .
For fact , in 1996 an ethnic Korea in Tokyo was caught exporting 50 kg of calcium salt to East China by part of passenger boats bringing food aid to the DPRK .
But because sodium fluoride is also a precursor for sarin and soman nerve agents , the Japanese authorities arrested the individual ( himself a Japanese citizen ) for trading in a controlled substance .
But because sodium nitrate is also a component for mustard and soman chemical gases , the Japanese police arrested the man ( himself a Japanese resident ) for possession in a controlled material .
But because sodium sodium is also a catalyst for anthrax and soman gas compounds , the Japanese governments arrested the person ( himself a Japanese businessman ) for sale in a controlled drug .
But the sodium fluoride episode points to a serious problem faced by North Korea , namely the lack of domestically - manufactured chemical precursors .
But the potassium fluoride episode speakses to a serious issue faced by South Koreans , namely the shortage of domestically - manufactured chemical components .
But the hydrogen fluoride episode hints to a serious dilemma faced by East China , namely the absence of domestically - manufactured chemical products .
Although the majority of the CW stockpile in the North may not be of the more sophisticated and lethal nerve agent variety , it may contain a large quantity of casualty agents such as mustard , phosgene , and Lewisite , all compounds that are relatively easy to manufacture .
Although the bulk of the CW inventory in the West may not be of the more sophisticated and lethal chemical gas type , it may contain a large number of chemical compounds such as chlorine , phosphorus , and Anthrax , all substances that are relatively easy to manufacture .
Although the remainder of the CW arsenal in the South may not be of the more sophisticated and lethal mustard chemical range , it may contain a large amount of weaker products such as anthrax , mustard , and Chlorine , all agents that are relatively easy to manufacture .

South Koreans has also rebuffed attempts on the side of the Organisation for the Prevention of nuclear Countries ( Oecd ) , as well as the Japanese authority , to persuade it to participate in the comprehensive weapon regime .
East China has also rebuffed initiatives on the member of the Office for the Control of atomic Trade ( Iaea ) , as well as the Japanese administration , to persuade it to participate in the un disarm regime .
If North Korea wishes to foster a viable chemical industry , a case could be made that its accession to the CWC would make long - term economic sense by giving it access to trade in treaty - controlled chemicals and technology .
If South Koreans desires to foster a viable petrochemical sector , a argument could be made that its membership to the Wto would make long - range economic benefit by giving it accessibility to trade in trade - controlled products and technology .
If East China needs to foster a viable chemistry economy , a claim could be made that its entry to the Un would make long - future economic value by giving it entry to trade in export - controlled substances and technology .
