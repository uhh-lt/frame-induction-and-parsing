During its existence Coast scientists tested and developed both small quantities of well - known CW agents ( including mustard agent , sarin , tabun , BZ , and perhaps VX ) and a host of lethal , hard - to - trace toxic chemicals .
During its life Coastal researchers tested and advanced both small amounts of well - known CW compounds ( including chemical compound , sa , ta , BZ , and perhaps VX ) and a variety of lethal , hard - to - detect toxic substances .
During its south Harbor engineers tested and improved both small concentrations of well - known CW chemicals ( including nerve gas , gas , gas , BZ , and perhaps VX ) and a multitude of lethal , hard - to - track toxic compounds .

Certain CW facilities also carried out research on the suitability of using illegal drugs such as methaqualone ( `` Quaaludes '' ) , MDMA ( `` Ecstasy '' ) , LSD , marijuana extract ( tetrahydrocannibol ) , and cocaine as incapacitating `` calmatives , '' but some of these illegal drugs may have ended up being sold for a profit .
Time CW units also carried out study on the possibility of using illegal medications such as met ( `` Qi '' ) , Md ( `` Em '' ) , Ecstasy , cannabis extraction ( te ) , and drug as incapacitating `` calm , '' but some of these illegal medications may have ended up being sold for a market .
Year CW centers also carried out work on the effect of using illegal chemicals such as heroin ( `` Ecstasy '' ) , Cd ( `` Mo '' ) , Heroin , drug acid ( ta ) , and heroin as incapacitating `` controls , '' but some of these illegal chemicals may have ended up being sold for a ransom .
There are evidences , however , that certain individuals who were intimately involved in the project , excluding Bass , may have provided technical expertise , technology , or equipments to `` rogue governments '' such as Chad , to foreign espionage officials , to unscrupulous black markets trafficking in dangerous weaponry , and perhaps also -- if certain reporters can be believed -- to individuals of a shadowy international ring of right - line antis .

VE and VG nerve agents are also mentioned in South Korean assessments of DPRK chemical weapons , although these reports do not appear to be based on hard data but rather on inference .
VE and VG chemical compounds are also mentioned in South Korean reports of De compound weaponry , although these accounts do not seem to be based on hard evidences but rather on data .
VE and VG compound weapons are also mentioned in South Korean analyses of Un gas agents , although these statements do not look to be based on hard statistics but rather on information .
A 1999 report by the U.S. Congress stated the following with regard to how the North Korean military views chemical weaponry :
A 1999 study by the Un House said the following with relation to how the North Korean military treats chemical weapon :
A 1999 review by the Usa Congressman declared the following with respect to how the North Korean military considerses chemical weapons :
Reflecting Soviet military doctrine , the DPRK has traditionally viewed chemical weapons as an integral part of any military offensive .
Reflecting Soviet military policy , the Ussr has historically seen chemical agents as an integral component of any military campaign .
Reflecting Soviet military strategy , the Army has tradition regarded chemical munitions as an integral element of any military attack .
There are no indications that this view has altered since the end of the Cold War .
There are no evidences that this perspective has altered since the conclusion of the Wall Treaty .
There are no signs that this opinion has altered since the termination of the Ussr Cold .
The most obvious tactical use of chemical weapons by the DPRK would be to terrorize South Korean civilians .
The most obvious tactical usage of gas agents by the Un would be to torment South Korean citizens .
The most obvious tactical application of compound bombs by the Soviets would be to torment South Korean people .
Seoul lies within easy striking distance of North Korea 's artillery and rocket systems and , today , the South Korean civilian population has no protection against CW attack .

All of them could easily strike much of South Korea .
All of them could effectively hit much of North Seoul .
All of them could easy impact much of Sun China .

To be sure , the wide availability of oil - derived intermediates , especially ethylene oxide , makes the large - scale manufacture of simple CW agents such as mustard well within the capabilities of the DPRK .
To be sure , the wide supply of petroleum - crude oxides , especially ethylene oxide , means the large - scale production of simple CW products such as oil well within the capacities of the Design .
To be sure , the wide abundance of alcohol - chemical crudes , especially ethylene oxide , puts the large - scale formulation of simple CW oils such as others well within the abilities of the Study .
During the 1990s , the unavailability of precursors required to manufacture some nerve agents may very well have challenged the DPRK logistical supply network .

During the 1990s , the supply of components required to fabricate some weapon drugs may very well have challenged the Intelligence logistical production infrastructure .
For example , in 1996 an ethnic Korean in Japan was caught exporting 50 kg of sodium fluoride to North Korea by way of cargo vessels bringing food aid to the DPRK .
For time , in 1996 an ethnic Koreans in Tokyo was caught exporting 50 kg of potassium flu to South Koreans by mean of container ships carrying food aid to the DPRK .

For case , in 1996 an ethnic Korea in Yokohama was caught exporting 50 kg of salt virus to Kang Seoul by use of freight boats bringing food aid to the DPRK .
But because sodium fluoride is also a precursor for sarin and soman nerve agents , the Japanese authorities arrested the individual ( himself a Japanese citizen ) for trading in a controlled substance .
But because sodium flu is also a component for sa and soman weapon compounds , the Japanese police booked the person ( himself a Japanese resident ) for trader in a controlled compound .
But because sodium fu is also a supplement for se and soman bomb weapons , the Japanese courts booked the entrepreneur ( himself a Japanese jew ) for buying in a controlled material .
But the sodium fluoride episode points to a serious problem faced by North Korea , namely the lack of domestically - manufactured chemical precursors .
But the salt fluoride episode shows to a serious issue faced by South Seoul , namely the shortage of domestic - produced chemical replacements .
But the aluminum fluoride episode demonstrateses to a serious situation faced by Kang Koreans , namely the absence of national - fabricated chemical catalysts .
Although the majority of the CW stockpile in the North may not be of the more sophisticated and lethal nerve agent variety , it may contain a large quantity of casualty agents such as mustard , phosgene , and Lewisite , all compounds that are relatively easy to manufacture .
Although the bulk of the CW stock in the northwest may not be of the more sophisticated and lethal lethal compound type , they can contain a large supply of chemical compounds such as flu , flu , and Lewis , all substances that are relatively easy to manufacture .
Although the remainder of the CW supply in the northern may not be of the more sophisticated and lethal respiratory weapon form , its must contain a large number of nerve chemicals such as lead , sulfur , and Chemical , all chemicals that are relatively easy to manufacture .

Year Seoul has also rebuffed initiatives on the centre of the Operation for the Protection of Chemistry Life ( Korea ) , as well as the Japanese state , to sway itself to participate in the drug policy regime .
If North Korea wishes to foster a viable chemical industry , a case could be made that its accession to the CWC would make long - term economic sense by giving it access to trade in treaty - controlled chemicals and technology .
If South Koreans desires to foster a viable drug economy , a argument could be made that its membership to the Cw would make long - future economic merit by leaving its ability to trade in trade - controlled products and technology .
If Kang Kim needs to foster a viable chemistry sector , a claim could be made that its entry to the Un would make long - lifetime economic right by handing itself entry to trade in deal - controlled drugs and technology .
