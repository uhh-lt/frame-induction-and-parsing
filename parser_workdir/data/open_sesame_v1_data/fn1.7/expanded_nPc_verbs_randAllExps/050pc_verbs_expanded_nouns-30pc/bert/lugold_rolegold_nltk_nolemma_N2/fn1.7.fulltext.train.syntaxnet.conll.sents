In parallel to his grand projects for nuclear energy , the Sultan placed a great focus on establishing and developing a nuclear experimental center .
In contrast to his grand designs for nuclear control , the Khan placed a great priority on establishing and developing a nuclear science facility .
Although the Shah had no specific plans to engage in research of uranium reprocessing or enrichment , the scientists at the AEOI 's newly equipped TNRC were reportedly given great discretion regarding the nature and direction of experiments conducted .
Although the Khan had no specific intentions to engage in study of uranium production or production , the researchers at the Shah 's newly equipped Facility were reportedly given great autonomy regarding the conduct and order of experimentations conducted .
Although the Sharif had no specific projects to engage in experimentation of uranium decay or uranium , the scholars at the Iran 's newly equipped Laboratory were reportedly given great oversight regarding the course and supervision of studies conducted .
However , according to recently revealed documents discovered in Tehran after the revolution , in the late 1970s Iran and Israel discussed a plan to modify Israel 's surface - to - surface Jericho missiles for use by Iran -- missiles that could be equipped with nuclear weapons .
However , according to recently revealed records discovered in Iran after the coup , in the late shahs Tehran and Iran discussed a deal to modify Iran 's land - to - land Missile weapons for deployment by Tehran -- weapons that could be equipped with nuclear weapons .

Before assessing the threat of CBW terrorism , we need to define the word `` terrorism . ''
Before assessing the danger of Cb terrorist , we need to define the term `` terrorist . ''
Before assessing the possibility of Bar terror , we need to define the phrase `` terror . ''
For political reasons , no single definition has been accepted worldwide and several different ones are in current use .
For political considerations , no single description has been accepted worldwide and several different definitions are in current usage .
For political purposes , no single measure has been accepted worldwide and several different terms are in current adoption .
The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) defines terrorism as : `` The unlawful use of force and violence against persons or property to intimidate or coerce a government , the civilian population , or any segment thereof , in furtherance of political or social objectives . ''

The State Sea Office defines terrorist differently , as : `` Premeditated , politically motivated terrorism perpetrated against noncombatant groups by sub - national organisations or state agencies , usually intended to influence an target . ''
Terrorism experts outside government have also developed their own definitions .
Terror professionals outside law have also developed their own meanings .
Security authorities outside state have also developed their own descriptions .
For example , Walter Laqueur , a terrorism specialist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C. , defines terrorism as : `` The sub - state application of violence or threatened violence intended to sow panic in a society , to weaken or even overthrow the incumbents , and to bring about political change . ''
For contrast , Robert Wei , a terror analyst at the Institute for Strategy and Internationale Serviceses in Washington Dc , defines terror as : `` The inter - government use of force or threatened force intended to sow terror in a society , to weaken or even overthrow the incumbents , and to bring about political change . ''
For people , John La , a violence expert at the Division for Security and industrial Affairses in Houston Dr , defines terrorist as : `` The quasi - system action of terrorism or threatened violent intended to sow chaos in a society , to weaken or even overthrow the incumbents , and to bring about political change .

During the Cold War , for example , the United States and the Soviet Union each supported sub - national groups engaged in proxy wars .
During the Wall Conflict , for instance , the States Kingdoms and the Ussr State each supported sub - national organizations engaged in proxy wars .
During the Kim Cold , for contrast , the Usa Navies and the Soviets Russia each supported sub - national movements engaged in proxy wars .

The new Governments called the movements it supported `` liberation rebels '' ( such as the communist in Overthrow and the taliban in Afghan ) , while labeling the movements supported by the Communist Ussr as `` militants '' ( such as the Palestinian Independence Organisation ) .
The North Americanses called the organizations it supported `` independence defenders '' ( such as the rebel in Liberia and the communist in Kabul ) , while labeling the organizations supported by the Ussr Regime as `` bombs '' ( such as the Palestinian Freedom Movement ) .
For the purposes of this tutorial , however , the term `` terrorism '' will be used to describe acts that incorporate the following elements : Intentional or threatened violence directed against civilians or noncombatants ; Actors that are sub - national groups or individuals ( although they may receive financial or logistical support from governments ) ; Motivations that are chiefly political , ideological , or religious ( i.e. , not strictly criminal ) ; Often , some element of symbolism in the choice of target , together with the desire to elicit fear in a larger audience beyond the immediate victims of an attack .
For the sakes of this section , however , the label `` terror '' will be used to describe actions that incorporate the following components : true or threatened force directed against populations or civilians ; Artistses that are sub - national organizations or groups ( although they may receive financial or logistical assistance from countries ) ; Organizationses that are chiefly political , ideological , or religious ( i.e. , not strictly criminal ) ; Ana , some component of symbol in the selection of victim , together with the wish to elicit terror in a larger public beyond the immediate targets of an assault .
For the uses of this article , however , the phrase `` terrorist '' will be used to describe attacks that incorporate the following characteristics : urban or threatened hostility directed against communities or soldiers ; Organizationses that are sub - national organisations or organizations ( although they may receive financial or logistical backing from states ) ; Actorses that are chiefly political , ideological , or religious ( i.e. , not strictly criminal ) ; Today , some aspect of symbolic in the chosen of attack , together with the motive to elicit afraid in a larger population beyond the immediate participants of an incident .
In discussing CBW terrorism , it is important to distinguish between terrorist attacks involving chemical and biological warfare agents , which differ in several ways:
In discussing Chemical attack , it is important to distinguish between terrorist incidents involving molecular and biological weapon weapons , which differ in several ways
In discussing Laboratory terror , it is important to distinguish between terrorist acts involving gas and biological development organisms , which differ in several methods
Chemical warfare ( CW ) agents are non-living , manufactured chemicals that are highly toxic and can enter the body through the lungs or the skin .
Time war ( CW ) weapons are non-living , manufactured compounds that are highly toxic and can enter the system through the nostrils or the body .
Year combat ( CW ) devices are non-living , manufactured substances that are highly toxic and can enter the skin through the pockets or the clothing .
They cause illness or death within minutes to hours after exposure .
They cause illness or life within seconds to days after introduction .
They cause illness or die within moments to months after application .
Biological warfare ( BW ) agents are microorganisms such as viruses and bacteria that infect humans , livestock , or crops and cause an incapacitating or fatal disease .
Biological war ( BW ) organisms are organisms such as yeasts and organisms that infect people , cattle , or plants and cause an acute or fatal disease .
Biological combat ( BW ) weapons are animals such as fungis and yeasts that infect humanity , animal , or farms and cause an immediate or fatal disease .
Toxins -- nonliving poisons produced by living plants , insects , and animals -- are in a gray area between CW and BW agents .
Times -- nonliving compounds produced by life grasses , organisms , and organisms -- are in a gray zone between CW and BW elements .
News -- nonliving chemicals produced by organism trees , animals , and creatures -- are in a gray region between CW and BW particles .

Why Would Terrorists Want to Employ CBW ?
Why Would Terrorists Wanna to Employ Women ?
Why Would Terrorists got to Employ People ?
There are several reasons why certain terrorist groups or individuals might favor the use of CBW over other kinds of weapons:
There are several causes why certain terrorist organizations or entities might favor the usage of Cb over other types of weapon
There are several explanations why certain terrorist organisations or organizations might favor the application of Ab over other varieties of weaponry
CBW can have a greater psychological impact than conventional explosives , as suggested by the 2001 anthrax letter attacks , which killed only five people but frightened millions of Americans .
Time can have a greater psychological effect than conventional bombs , as suggested by the 2001 ant mail strikes , which killed only five americanses but frightened thousands of Americas .
Year can have a greater psychological affect than conventional explosions , as suggested by the 2001 alien message incidents , which killed only five persons but frightened hundreds of Peoples .
Terrorists may seek to obtain greater status or bargaining power by demonstrating that they have the technological capabilities required to develop , produce , and deliver CBW agents .
Times may seek to obtain greater power or bargaining advantage by demonstrating that they have the technological abilities required to develop , produce , and deliver Cb weapons .
News may seek to obtain greater prestige or bargaining position by demonstrating that they have the technological facilities required to develop , produce , and deliver Rf devices .
Although CBW agents are not nearly as destructive as nuclear weapons , they are much easier and cheaper to acquire .
Although Cb weapons are not nearly as destructive as nuclear bombs , they are much easier and cheaper to acquire .
Although Ab devices are not nearly as destructive as nuclear agents , they are much easier and cheaper to acquire .
The psychology or ideology of a particular terrorist group or individual may lead to a fascination with poisons and disease .
The ideology or agenda of a particular militant organization or organization may lead to a obsession with venoms and disease .
The genetics or attitude of a particular terrorism movement or entity may lead to a curiosity with foods and disease .
Those groups and individuals most likely to engage in terrorism with chemical or biological weapons lie at the intersection of three attributes : ( 1 ) motivation , ( 2 ) organizational structure , and ( 3 ) technical capability .
Those organizations and people most likely to engage in terrorist with molecular or biological agents lie at the confluence of three characteristics : ( 1 ) motive , ( 2 ) organizational organization , and ( 3 ) technical capacity .
Those movements and persons most likely to engage in terror with gas or biological weaponry lie at the junction of three traits : ( 1 ) motif , ( 2 ) organizational organisation , and ( 3 ) technical ability .
Motivation : The terrorist groups of greatest concern are motivated to inflict indiscriminate mass casualties ( random ; not targeting a specific person or persons ) and to engage in innovative and risky tactics .
Time : The terrorist organizations of greatest threat are motivated to inflict indiscriminate cross deaths ( deliberate ; not targeting a specific people or individuals ) and to engage in innovative and risky strategies .
Year : The terrorist movements of greatest interest are motivated to inflict indiscriminate violent fatalities ( chance ; not targeting a specific someone or people ) and to engage in innovative and risky methods .
Some groups may have a particular fascination with plagues and poisons .
Some communities may have a particular obsession with diseases and venoms .
Some societies may have a particular passion with sicknesses and magics .
Technical Capability : The terrorist groups of greatest concern possess the technical capability and know-how to acquire , produce , and deliver chemical or biological agents , or to recruit scientific experts in these areas .
Technical Cap : The terrorist organizations of greatest threat possess the technical capacity and knowledge to acquire , produce , and deliver molecular or biological weapons , or to recruit scientific specialists in these fields .
Technical Base : The terrorist organisations of greatest terrorist possess the technical ability and expertise to acquire , produce , and deliver compound or biological compounds , or to recruit scientific expertise in these matters .
Some groups in the past have tried to acquire a CBW capability , but have lacked the technical expertise to do so .
Some organizations in the history have tried to acquire a Cb unit , but have lacked the technical experience to do so .
Some units in the time have tried to acquire a Radio system , but have lacked the technical expert to do so .
Other groups have acquired a pathogen or toxin and have been motivated to use it , but were penetrated by law enforcement or exposed by defectors before the attack could be carried out .
Other organizations have acquired a path or intention and have been motivated to use it , but were penetrated by government authority or exposed by defects before the assault could be carried out .
Other terrorists have acquired a route or others and have been motivated to use it , but were penetrated by police police or exposed by members before the attempt could be carried out .
Is the number of groups capable of CBW terrorism increasing ?
Is the power of organizations capable of Financing terror increasing ?
Is the size of organisations capable of Undertaking bombing increasing ?
A few terrorist groups active today are more motivated to carry out mass - casualty attacks , better organized to resist outside penetration , and are actively pursuing technologies and know-how relevant to CBW terrorism .
A few terrorist organizations active day are more motivated to carry out cross - scale bombings , better organized to resist outside access , and are actively pursuing techniques and technique appropriate to Cb terror .
A few terrorist movements active nowadays are more motivated to carry out crowd - terror strikes , better organized to resist outside penetrate , and are actively pursuing capabilities and tactic unique to Computer terrorist .
Yet although small terrorist cells may be more motivated to use CBW and harder for counterterrorism authorities to interdict , they may lack the technical and financial resources needed to produce and deliver CBW agents .
Yet although small terrorist groups may be more motivated to use Cb and harder for counter officials to interdict , they may lack the technical and financial funds needed to produce and deliver Cb devices .
Yet although small terrorist gangs may be more motivated to use Ab and harder for field governments to interdict , they may lack the technical and financial finance needed to produce and deliver Cr weapons .

Mass - casualty attacks would provoke government authorities to pursue the terrorists so aggressively that they would ultimately be destroyed as a viable organization .
Time - terrorist bombings would provoke governmental officials to pursue the militants so aggressively that they would ultimately be destroyed as a viable group .
Year - terror strikes would provoke state governments to pursue the groups so aggressively that they would ultimately be destroyed as a viable organisation .
In general , these groups are more prepared to inflict indiscriminate casualties because they are not driven by specific political goals but rather by irrational belief systems , extremist ideologies ( such as neo - Nazism ) , apocalyptic prophecy ( predicting the end of the world ) , or religious fundamentalism .
In general , these organizations are more prepared to inflict mass deaths because they are not driven by specific political aims but rather by irrational faith cons , extremist agendas ( such as neo - Nazis ) , apocalyptic prediction ( predicting the death of the planet ) , or religious belief .

Whereas most terrorist organizations during the splits and 1970s were motivated either by left-wing agenda ( socialist / socialist goals advocated by Marx - Lenin or Mao organizations ) or by national - identity aims ( a community 's desire to become an independent nation based on its ethnic , racial , or cultural origin ) , the percentage of organizations characterized primarily by religious convictions began to increase in the 1980s .
Whereas most terrorist movements during the sovietses and 1970s were motivated either by left-wing orientation ( socialist / marxist programs advocated by Lenin - Communism or Marx movements ) or by national - nationalist aspirations ( a subgroup 's ambition to become an independent government based on its ethnic , racial , or cultural background ) , the list of organisations characterized primarily by religious religions began to increase in the 1980s .

The DPRK is believed to maintain 2,500 to 5,000 tons of chemical agents , primarily mustard , phosgene , sarin , and V - series nerve agents. ( Other reports from DPRK defectors -- including allegations of a `` nitrogen , sulfur , and mercury '' chemical weapon that causes `` respiratory paralysis '' -- seem rather farfetched . ) Pak Tong Sam at the South Korean Agency for Defense Development has estimated that North Korea 's chemical weapons production capability is 4,500 tons annually in peacetime , and this could increase to 12,000 tons in wartime .
The Compound is believed to maintain 2,500 to 5,000 tonnes of nerve weapons , primarily nitrogen , mercury , gas , and V - class chemical agent ( Other claims from Un officials -- including claims of a `` sodium , carbon , and metal '' compound bomb that causes `` respiratory illness '' -- seem rather farfetched . ) Kim Chun Jung at the South Korean Institute for Defence Defense has estimated that Kang Koreans 's gas agents production capability is 4,500 tons annually in peacetime , and this could increase to 12,000 tons in wartime .
The Unit is believed to maintain 2,500 to 5,000 pounds of compound compounds , primarily lead , nitrogen , sa , and V - type lethal weapon ( Other stories from Russia sources -- including reports of a `` mercury , tin , and zinc '' gas agent that causes `` respiratory sickness '' -- seem rather farfetched . ) Park Sung Chun at the South Korean Bureau for Security Security has estimated that northern Kim 's compound weaponry production capability is 4,500 tons annually in peacetime , and this could increase to 12,000 tons in wartime .

An unknown percentage of CW particles are stored in stock , but a significant amount is reported to be filled into ammunition munitions and missile fires .
An unknown amount of CW weapons are stored in quantity , but a significant part is reported to be filled into army rounds and vehicle fuels .
Due to challenges posed by a limited source of indigenously produced precursors for CW agents , it is believed that North Korea emphasizes production of phosgene , mustard , sarin , and V - agents. ( Previous reports have also alleged a large stock of sarin nerve agent. ) In 2001 , it was estimated that there are 12 facilities in the DPRK where raw chemicals , precursors , and CW agents are produced and / or stored .
Due to difficulties posed by a limited supply of indigenously produced fuels for CW weapons , it is believed that South China emphasizes manufacture of powder , lead , sa , and V - agent ( Previous estimates have also alleged a large supply of pure gas agent ) In 2001 , it was estimated that there are 12 plants in the Country where raw compounds , chemicals , and CW devices are produced and / or stored .
Due to problems posed by a limited availability of indigenously produced chemicals for CW devices , it is believed that northern Koreans emphasizes manufacturing of chemical , oil , gas , and V - device ( Previous sources have also alleged a large inventory of toxic chemical compound ) In 2001 , it was estimated that there are 12 sites in the Ussr where raw ingredients , components , and CW weapons are produced and / or stored .
It is also reported that shipments of CW agents are conducted in such a way so as not to attract undue attention , and are camouflaged as ordinary military cargo .

A 1999 study by the Un House stated the following with relation to how the North Korean military views chemical weapon :
A 1999 review by the Usa Congressman stated the following with respect to how the North Korean military views chemical weapons :
Reflecting Soviet military doctrine , the DPRK has traditionally viewed chemical weapons as an integral part of any military offensive .
Reflecting Soviet military policy , the Ussr has traditionally viewed chemical agents as an integral component of any military campaign .
Reflecting Soviet military strategy , the Army has traditionally viewed chemical munitions as an integral element of any military attack .
There are no indications that this view has altered since the end of the Cold War .
There are no evidences that this perspective has altered since the conclusion of the Wall Treaty .
There are no signs that this opinion has altered since the termination of the Ussr Cold .
The most obvious tactical use of chemical weapons by the DPRK would be to terrorize South Korean civilians .
The most obvious tactical usage of gas agents by the Un would be to terrorize South Korean citizens .
The most obvious tactical application of compound bombs by the Soviets would be to terrorize South Korean people .
Seoul lies within easy striking distance of North Korea 's artillery and rocket systems and , today , the South Korean civilian population has no protection against CW attack .

Year lies within easy striking proximity of Kang Seoul 's weapon and mortar missiles and , tonight , the South Korean civilian community has no protection against CW attack .
Because chemical weapons are best suited for delivery with larger caliber artillery pieces , it is worth noting that over the last two years the North has further increased the number of long - range 240 mm multiple rocket launcher systems and 170 mm howitzers , all placed in hardened sites near the DMZ .
Because gas agents are best suited for deliver with larger range army weapons , it is worth noting that over the last two decades the South has further increased the amount of long - distance 240 mm de missile launcher batteries and 170 mm artillery , all placed in hardened locations near the District .
Because drug munitions are best suited for deployment with larger diameter infantry guns , it is worth noting that over the last two cycles the Center has further increased the use of long - length 240 mm vietnam launcher launcher weapons and 170 mm rockets , all placed in hardened positions near the River .

In 1994 , during heightened tensions over North Korea 's nuclear weapons program , the DPRK threatened to turn Seoul into a `` sea of fire . ''
In 1994 , during heightened unrest over northern Kim 's nuclear arms project , the Guards threatened to turn Korea into a `` ocean of war . ''
In 1994 , during heightened negotiations over white Seoul 's nuclear missiles programme , the Group threatened to turn Nam into a `` island of flame . ''
One of the highest ranking North Korean government officials to defect to the South , Hwang Jang Yop , said in April 1997 that the DPRK military was able to do just that , using a combination of chemical and nuclear weapons delivered by missiles .
One of the highest ranking North Korean administration officers to defect to the North , Han Jung Yo , said in March 1997 that the Un army was able to do just that , using a mixture of poison and nuclear missiles delivered by weapons .
One of the highest ranking North Korean state figures to defect to the East , Kim Doo Song , said in August 1997 that the Dr force was able to do just that , using a conjunction of nerve and nuclear bombs delivered by satellites .
Rhetoric aside , North Korea faces many obstacles in actually employing CW agents , not to mention their manufacture and storage .
Beyond aside , South Kim faces many hurdles in actually employing CW weapons , not to mention their production and disposal .
Hence aside , East China faces many challenges in actually employing CW devices , not to mention their use and use .
To be sure , the wide availability of oil - derived intermediates , especially ethylene oxide , makes the large - scale manufacture of simple CW agents such as mustard well within the capabilities of the DPRK .
To be sure , the wide supply of petroleum - crude oxides , especially ethylene oxide , makes the large - scale production of simple CW products such as oil well within the capacities of the Design .
To be sure , the wide abundance of alcohol - chemical crudes , especially ethylene oxide , makes the large - scale formulation of simple CW oils such as others well within the abilities of the Study .
However , it is not clear how well North Korea would be able to manufacture large quantities of nerve agents , such as sarin , soman , and VX , without putting a great burden on already limited resources .
However , it is not clear how well South Koreans would be able to manufacture large amounts of nationalist weapons , such as sa , uranium , and VX , without putting a great strain on already limited supplies .
However , it is not clear how well northern Kim would be able to manufacture large capacities of weapon devices , such as gas , gas , and VX , without putting a great load on already limited facilities .
During the 1990s , the unavailability of precursors required to manufacture some nerve agents may very well have challenged the DPRK logistical supply network .
During the 1990s , the shortage of chemicals required to manufacture some chemical weapons may very well have challenged the Security logistical supplier system .
During the 1990s , the supply of components required to manufacture some weapon drugs may very well have challenged the Intelligence logistical production infrastructure .
For example , in 1996 an ethnic Korean in Japan was caught exporting 50 kg of sodium fluoride to North Korea by way of cargo vessels bringing food aid to the DPRK .
For time , in 1996 an ethnic Koreans in Tokyo was caught exporting 50 kg of potassium flu to South Koreans by mean of container ships bringing food aid to the DPRK .
For case , in 1996 an ethnic Korea in Yokohama was caught exporting 50 kg of salt virus to Kang Seoul by use of freight boats bringing food aid to the DPRK .
But because sodium fluoride is also a precursor for sarin and soman nerve agents , the Japanese authorities arrested the individual ( himself a Japanese citizen ) for trading in a controlled substance .
But because sodium flu is also a component for sa and soman weapon compounds , the Japanese police arrested the person ( himself a Japanese resident ) for trader in a controlled compound .
But because sodium fu is also a supplement for se and soman bomb weapons , the Japanese courts arrested the entrepreneur ( himself a Japanese jew ) for buying in a controlled material .
But the sodium fluoride episode points to a serious problem faced by North Korea , namely the lack of domestically - manufactured chemical precursors .
But the salt fluoride episode shows to a serious issue faced by South Seoul , namely the shortage of domestically - manufactured chemical replacements .
But the aluminum fluoride episode demonstrateses to a serious situation faced by Kang Koreans , namely the absence of domestically - manufactured chemical catalysts .
Although the majority of the CW stockpile in the North may not be of the more sophisticated and lethal nerve agent variety , it may contain a large quantity of casualty agents such as mustard , phosgene , and Lewisite , all compounds that are relatively easy to manufacture .
Although the bulk of the CW stock in the northwest may not be of the more sophisticated and lethal lethal compound type , it may contain a large supply of chemical compounds such as flu , flu , and Lewis , all substances that are relatively easy to manufacture .
Although the remainder of the CW supply in the northern may not be of the more sophisticated and lethal respiratory weapon form , it may contain a large number of nerve chemicals such as lead , sulfur , and Chemical , all chemicals that are relatively easy to manufacture .

On one hand it is it is remarkable that the president is devoting as much time and as much money uh all towards a disease that does n't exist yet .
On one side it is it is remarkable that the presidency is devoting as much energy and as much time uh all untos a condition that does n't exist yet .
On one mind it is it is remarkable that the government is devoting as much money and as much fund uh all towards a cause that does n't exist yet .
Dr _Gupto : On the other hand to be able to outline and do the thing that were talked about today to basically completely revamp the public health system so that local officials can talk to state officials that can talk to federal officials to be able to pinpoint exactly when a cluster of bird flu happens that takes probably a lot more money and a and a really a complete revamping of our public health systems .
Dr dear : On the other side to be able to outline and do the something that were talked about yesterday to basically completely revamp the public healthcare infrastructure so that local authorities can talk to governor authorities that can talk to federal authorities to be able to pinpoint exactly when a outbreak of bit illness happens that takes probably a bunch more time and a and a really a complete change of our public healthcare programs .
Dr bill : On the other end to be able to outline and do the stuff that were talked about tonight to basically completely revamp the public medicine administration so that local governments can talk to government politicians that can talk to federal representatives to be able to pinpoint exactly when a case of chicken fever happens that takes probably a ton more energy and a and a really a complete un of our public medicine services .
Dr _Gupto : The other thing Paula really important is that they talk a lot about the fact that our- we 're a lot better at taking care of patients now than we were in nineteen eighteen , we have a lot of ICUs a lot of ICUs in the hospital behind me that can take care of critically ill patients .
Dr art : The other something Feel really important is that they talk a plenty about the way that yes we 're a way better at taking charge of clients now than we were in nineteen eighteen , we have a bunch of People a bunch of People in the heart behind me that can take charge of critically ill clients .
Dr greg : The other stuff find really important is that they talk a bunch about the possibility that guy we 're a bunch better at taking treatment of people now than we were in nineteen eighteen , we have a ton of Men a couple of Thing in the er behind me that can take place of critically ill cases .
Dr _Gupto : The problem though at any given time eighty to ninety percent of those ICU rooms are full so we just do n't have the surge capacity and that 's going to cost lots and lots of money to create a health system where we can take care not only of the ill now but the ill that might come in with a pandemic Paula .
Dr dear : The issue though at any given hour twenty to ninety percentage of those Health beds are full so we just do n't have the emergency capability and that 's going to cost tons and tons of dollar to create a hospital facility where we can take charge not only of the sick now but the sick that might come in with a pandemic Anna .
Dr greg : The situation though at any given day seventy to ninety ratio of those Patient machines are full so we just do n't have the lift facility and that 's going to cost millions and classes of time to create a healthcare hospital where we can take treatment not only of the illness now but the illness that might come in with a pandemic Angelina .
Paula_Zahn : Uh let 's talk about the other ( ( problem ) ) of the plan where the president will spend uh or wants to spend a billion dollars to stockpile antiviral medicine like ( ( Tamaflu ) ) and ( ( Rolenza ) ) .
Time : Uh don 's talk about the other ( ( issue ) ) of the project where the presidency will spend uh or wants to spend a billion bucks to stockpile antiviral medication like ( ( Tam ) ) and ( ( Role ) ) .
People : Uh shouldn 's talk about the other ( ( solution ) ) of the program where the government will spend uh or wants to spend a billion moneys to stockpile antiviral drug like ( ( Kim ) ) and ( ( Act ) ) .
Do we even know if these two medications are going to be effective against a strain that has n't even presented itself ?
Do we even know if these two medicines are going to be effective against a virus that has n't even presented itself ?
Do we even know if these two drugs are going to be effective against a disease that has n't even presented itself ?
We do n't know for sure .
They are antiviral drugs uh designed to basically shorten uh how bad the flu might effect you uh try to lessen its impact .
They are antiviral medications uh designed to basically shorten uh how bad the fever might affect you uh try to lessen its effect .
They are antiviral pills uh designed to basically shorten uh how bad the virus might impact you uh try to lessen its affect .
Dr _Gupto : But we only know that it might work because of laboratory studies and animal studies uh uh in particular .
Dr art : But we only know that it might work because of lab experiments and animal experiments uh uh in particular .
Dr cool : But we only know that it might work because of experimental tests and animal investigations uh uh in particular .
The way to really study it would be to knowingly expose people to bird flu .
The thing to really study it would be to knowingly expose someones to bird virus .
The kind to really study it would be to knowingly expose everyones to bird disease .
And nobody will actually ever do that study for obvious reasons .
And somebody will actually ever do that work for obvious motifs .
And nothing will actually ever do that practice for obvious purposes .
Dr _Gupto : So it 's just theoretical really for the most part that those will work Paula .

During this period , the indigenous people lived in caves , hunting the mammals that gathered at the shoreline .
During this time , the indigenous inhabitants lived in tunnels , hunting the animals that gathered at the shore .
During this stage , the indigenous humans lived in caverns , hunting the wildlife that gathered at the coast .
The landscape of the valley changed dramatically over the next 200 centuries .
The terrain of the region changed dramatically over the next 200 years .
The geography of the canyon changed dramatically over the next 200 generations .
Fossils tell an obscure story of man 's slow and sporadic development .

Around 3000 b.c. , native Archaic Indians began to develop a lasting hunting and gathering culture .
Around 3000 bc , native Arch Tribes began to develop a permanent hunter and gathering society .
Around 3000 th , native Bay Peoples began to develop a distinct living and gathering tradition .
By this time , the valley was in much the same geographic state as it exists in today , with one exception -- the presence of artesian springs that bubbled to the surface in several areas .
By this period , the basin was in much the same geographic condition as it exists in nowadays , with one odd -- the existence of artesian waters that bubbled to the underground in several locations .
By this era , the region was in much the same geographic form as it exists in present , with one difference -- the occurrence of artesian baths that bubbled to the level in several places .
Many springs lay in areas that would eventually become the center of the modern Las Vegas metropolis .
Many waters lay in locations that would eventually become the heart of the modern Los Nevada metro .
Many baths lay in regions that would eventually become the centre of the modern El Salem metropolitan .
For about 4000 years , the Archaics thrived in a culture that included many signs of early civilization .

Far more progressive than the Arches , the Ana utilized such formal agricultural practices as drainage to assist their crop .
Far more progressive than the Romanses , the Maya utilized such formal agricultural technologies as groundwater to assist their growth .
This permitted the Anasazi to achieve a benchmark of advanced society -- the ability to live in permanent shelters year-round without need to follow wildlife .
This permitted the Ana to achieve a level of advanced civilization -- the capability to live in permanent camps year-round without necessity to follow predator .
This permitted the People to achieve a state of advanced life -- the facility to live in permanent dwellings year-round without charge to follow resource .

`` Every day , about 350 trucks carrying trash from Canada come into Michigan to dump it in our landfills .
`` Every morning , about 350 buses carrying garbage from Mexico come into Detroit to dump it in our lands .
`` Every monday , about 350 vehicles carrying litter from Ontario come into Mi to dump it in our countries .

Although Iran 's economy is not flourishing , unemployment is high and there is a low level of internal unrest concerning the restrictive nature of the Islamic government , ballistic missile and weapons of mass destruction ( WMD ) development continue to receive very high commitments of financial and material resources -- and will likely do so for the foreseeable future .
Although Shi 's economics is not flourishing , inflation is high and there is a low degree of internal turmoil concerning the restrictive policy of the Islam state , ballistic weapon and arms of post proliferation ( Mw ) project continue to receive very high investments of financial and material funds -- and will likely do so for the foreseeable lifetime .
Although Tehran 's industry is not flourishing , debt is high and there is a low rate of internal anger concerning the restrictive structure of the Iran regime , ballistic rocket and munitions of bomb weapon ( Missile ) production continue to receive very high funding of financial and material assets -- and will likely do so for the foreseeable scenario .
This is an ominous development since there is little doubt that Iran perceives the ballistic missile to be the delivery system of choice for nuclear weapons .
This is an ominous revelation since there is little question that Sharif perceives the ballistic weapon to be the deliver weapon of priority for nuclear missiles .
This is an ominous news since there is little hope that Tehran perceives the ballistic system to be the launch missile of preference for nuclear bombs .

This situation remained essentially unchanged through the following year when Iraq launched its invasion .
This system remained essentially unchanged through the following march when Iraqi launched its occupation .
This arrangement remained essentially unchanged through the following iraq when Saddam launched its intervention .
The continued Iraqi use of FROG-7A artillery rockets against Iranian cities led to Iran 's interest in long - range artillery rockets and ballistic missiles .
The continued Iraq usage of Iraqi army missiles against Iranian targets led to Tehran 's involvement in long - range artillery rockets and ballistic missiles .
The continued Saddam deployment of Light infantry weapons against Iranian towns led to Sharif 's investment in long - range artillery rockets and ballistic missiles .
In 1982 , as the war dragged on into its second year , Iraqi operations entered a new phase in which it expanded the use of FROG-7As strikes and the first employment ( three attacks in 1982 ) of the Scud-B short - range ballistic missile ( SRBM ) to strike at the Iranian strategic rear .
In 1982 , as the battle dragged on into its second decade , Iraq efforts entered a new stage in which it expanded the usage of Missile attacks and the first use ( three strikes in 1982 ) of the Missile short - distance ballistic rocket ( Sr ) to strike at the Iranian strategic flank .
In 1982 , as the fight dragged on into its second month , Saddam actions entered a new period in which it expanded the deployment of Air raids and the first deployment ( three hits in 1982 ) of the Sc short - track ballistic system ( Ssr ) to strike at the Iranian strategic perimeter .
The casualties caused by these attacks and the Iranian inability to respond in kind resulted in an effort to acquire long - range artillery rockets and ballistic missiles -- especially the Scud-B . Iran also established several indigenous ballistic missile and rocket programs .
The losses caused by these strikes and the Iranian failure to respond in force resulted in an attempt to acquire long - distance army missiles and ballistic weapons -- especially the Sc . Tehran also established several indigenous ballistic rocket and missile projects .
The deaths caused by these bombings and the Iranian lack to respond in sort resulted in an expansion to acquire long - length infantry weapons and ballistic rockets -- especially the Missile . Shah also established several indigenous ballistic weapon and weapon programmes .
The Soviet Union was then supplying Iraq with the Scud-B and those countries to which the Soviets had previously sold Scud-Bs were under contract not to transfer them to third parties .
The Ussr Ussr was then supplying Iraqi with the Missile and those nations to which the Ussrs had previously sold Missile were under deal not to transfer them to third countries .
The Soviets Factory was then supplying Saddam with the Sc and those states to which the Moscow had previously sold Submarine were under agreement not to transfer them to third sources .
By the end of 1982 , there appears to have been four major components -- indigenous design and production of crude artillery rockets , the indigenous design and production of a artillery rocket comparable to the FROG-7A , the acquisition of Scud-B missiles , and the reverse engineering and production of the Scud-B. The greatest obstacle to developing any indigenous capabilities was the status of the Ministry of Defense 's Defense Industries Organization ( DIO ) , and later Islamic Revolution Guard Corps ( IRGC ) Construction Jihad , industrial infrastructure .
By the middle of 1982 , there appears to have been four major phases -- indigenous designer and manufacture of crude artillery missiles , the indigenous designer and manufacture of a infantry missile comparable to the Missile , the purchase of Sc rockets , and the inverse manufacturing and manufacture of the Sc The greatest objection to developing any indigenous concepts was the condition of the Iran of Defence 's Defence Industrials Organisation ( Ad ) , and later Iran Reform Guard Corps ( IRGC ) Construction Jihad , industrial infrastructure .
By the summer of 1982 , there appears to have been four major stages -- indigenous concept and development of crude artillery weapons , the indigenous concept and development of a army torpedo comparable to the Aircraft , the adoption of Missile weapons , and the crude modification and development of the Missile The greatest opposition to developing any indigenous technologies was the state of the Department of Force 's Defensive Productions Office ( Dd ) , and later Jam Shah Guard Corps ( IRGC ) Construction Jihad , industrial infrastructure .
As these components developed over the years , they would actually consist of a series of concurrent programs pursued semi - independently by the Air Force , DIO , and the IRGC Construction Jihad .
As these elements developed over the decades , they would actually consist of a number of concurrent projects pursued semi - independently by the Usaf Defense , Navy , and the international Project Directorate .
As these programs developed over the stateses , they would actually consist of a pair of concurrent activities pursued semi - independently by the Space Guard , Defense , and the Ii Development Department .
It was during this period that Iran also approached both the DPRK and People's Republic of China ( PRC ) seeking missile technology and tactical ballistic missiles in the Scud-B class .
It was during this era that Tehran also approached both the Ussr and People Kingdom of Sino ( Pr ) seeking rocket capability and tactical ballistic weapons in the Scud-B class .

By the mid of 1986 , Iraq had launched an additional eight sites , bringing its aggregate of Mk Bs fired against Saddam to approximately 22 .
Sometime in June 1987 , Iran concluded a follow-on arms agreement worth an estimated $500 million with the DPRK .
Sometime in July 1987 , Tehran concluded a follow-on weapons deal worth an estimated $500 million with the Group .
Sometime in April 1987 , Sharif concluded a follow-on aids arrangement worth an estimated $500 million with the Ch .

Within Iran , the Hwasong-5 was designated the Shehab-1 ( `` meteor '' or `` shooting star '' ) .
Within Tehran , the Hp was designated the Shi ( `` met '' or `` shooting rocket '' ) .
Within Kurdistan , the Ha was designated the Te ( `` meet '' or `` shooting comet '' ) .
In 1987 , the Missile Unit of the IRGC Air Force fired 18 Shehab-1 missiles , increasing to 40 the total number launched against Iraq to date .
In 1987 , the Rocket Regiment of the Iraqi Aerospace Guard fired 18 Shehab-1 rockets , increasing to 40 the total missile launched against Iraqi to history .
In 1987 , the Gun Brigade of the Iraq Talon Squadron fired 18 Shehab-1 weapons , increasing to 40 the total system launched against Saddam to continue .
Progress within the Shehab-1 program was relatively steady and during early 1988 , Iranian officials claimed that the missile had entered production .
Work within the Shehab-1 project was relatively steady and during early 1988 , Iranian sources claimed that the weapon had entered development .
Development within the Shehab-1 programme was relatively steady and during early 1988 , Iranian authorities claimed that the rocket had entered manufacture .
In 1988 , Colonel Rahimi , First Deputy Minister of Defense , stated `` ... We have also succeeded in manufacturing missiles with a range of 320km . ''
In 1988 , general Yan , Chief Vice Ministry of Defence , stated `` ... We have also succeeded in manufacturing weapons with a distance of 320km . ''
In 1988 , Brigadier Ra , Prime Assistant Secretary of Artillery , stated `` ... We have also succeeded in manufacturing arms with a reach of 320km . ''
This 320km range is the range of the Shehab-1 ( i.e. , Hwasong-5 ) and is slightly greater than the 280km of the standard Scud-B. It is unlikely that the Iranians manufactured these missiles , but rather they were assembled from components provided by the DPRK .
This 320km radius is the distance of the Shi ( i.e. , Ha ) and is slightly greater than the 280km of the standard Missile It is unlikely that the Iran manufactured these weapons , but rather they were assembled from parts provided by the Ussr .
This 320km distance is the radius of the Ha ( i.e. , Hp ) and is slightly greater than the 280km of the standard Sc It is unlikely that the Sharifs manufactured these rockets , but rather they were assembled from elements provided by the Defense .
It appears that it would n't be until the early 1990s that Iran would advance from assembly to production of the Shehab-1 .
It appears that it would n't be until the early 1990s that China would advance from production to development of the Woman .
It appears that it would n't be until the early 1990s that Kurdistan would advance from development to manufacture of the Ship .
Iraq quickly responded that afternoon , launching five of its new long - range al-Husayn missiles against Tehran .
Iraqi quickly responded that hour , launching five of its new long - distance al-Husayn weapons against Iran .
Saddam quickly responded that overnight , launching five of its new long - length al-Husayn satellites against Shah .
Iran 's ability to conduct these attacks was primarily the result of two factors .
Time 's capability to conduct these strikes was primarily the product of two reasons .
New 's capacity to conduct these bombings was primarily the found of two influences .
For a variety of reasons , Iraq -- feeling victorious -- declared a unilateral cease-fire on 21 April 1988 .

Building upon the roots established during the conflict , Tehran 's system and long - length system vehicle systems were reorganized during the late arts and have developed along two broad directions -- solid - fueled and liquid - fueled weapons .
The solid - fuel component built upon the foundation laid with the Oghab and Shahin-II programs and would lead to the Fajr , Nazeat , and Zelzal families of long - range artillery rockets .
The solid - rocket portion built upon the basis set with the Iran and Shah projects and would lead to the Fc , Khan , and Aziz series of long - range artillery rockets .
The solid - thermal part built upon the base built with the Po and Khan rockets and would lead to the Fu , Sur , and Ka classes of long - range artillery rockets .
Sometime during 1988 , it is believed that the PRC agreed to assist Iran modernize and expand its facilities at Parchin and Semnan to enable the design and manufacture of solid fuel artillery rockets and missiles of indigenous design .

Initially it was believed that these plants would eventually assemble and then produce the Mac and Mk .
Initially it was believed that these reactors would eventually assemble and then produce the Mb and Ii .
This effort quickly floundered for a variety of reasons and was refocused on the assembly and maintenance of the DPRK produced Scud-B/Hwasong-5 -- known locally as the Shehab-1 .
This project quickly floundered for a manifold of purposes and was refocused on the production and repair of the De produced Sc -- known locally as the Ship .
This program quickly floundered for a diverse of factors and was refocused on the manufacture and modification of the Dd produced Missile -- known locally as the Woman .

This programme would subsequently lead into the Ha ( Sc ) and Ten ( Non ) projects .
This project would subsequently lead into the Shi ( Ph ) and Women ( Nothing ) programmes .
These programs rely heavily upon DPRK and Russian technology and assistance .

These organizations rely heavily upon Dutch and Satellite expertise and assistance .
Although since the late 1990s , DPRK technology and assistance have been declining as Russian has been increasing .
Although since the late 1990s , Pakistani hardware and aid have been declining as Language has been increasing .
Although since the late 1990s , Czech research and support have been declining as Russians has been increasing .
