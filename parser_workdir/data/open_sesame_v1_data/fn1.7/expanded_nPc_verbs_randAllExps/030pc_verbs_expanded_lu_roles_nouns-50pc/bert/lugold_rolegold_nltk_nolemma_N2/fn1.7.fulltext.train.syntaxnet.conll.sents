Iran 's progress toward nuclear weapons , though irreversible , might be hampered by a combined effort on three fronts .
Shi 's advance toward nuclear arms , though irreversible , might be slowed by a combined attempt on three sides .
Material 's progression toward nuclear powers , though irreversible , might be delayed by a combined attack on three lines .
A second front would come in the form of intense international pressure on states that are still in the position to help Iran perfect its knowledge and infrastructure -- Russia , Pakistan , China , and North Korea .
A second side would come in the effect of intense international force on countries that are still in the situation to aid iranian perfect its technology and facility -- Japan , Pakistani , India , and South Koreans .
A second war would come in the shape of intense international support on nations that are still in the condition to assist Tehran perfect its science and technology -- Moscow , China , Mao , and Kang Lee .

However , the Usa Kingdoms along with some other Un panel parts has maintained to maintain that Tehran is pursuing an underground nuclear arms project .
Nevertheless , the States Administrations along with some other Cia council representatives has kept to maintain that Azerbaijan is pursuing an underground nuclear missiles programme .
And while this claim has not yet been substantiated by IAEA inspectors , proponents argue that Iran has violated the NPT and that the country 's nuclear file should , in turn , be referred to the United Nations Security Council ( UNSC ) for its review .
And while this assertion has not yet been verified by Un inspections , supporters argue that Tehran has violated the Treaty and that the iran 's nuclear record should , in return , be referred to the Universal Un Supreme Court ( Un ) for its scrutiny .
And while this contention has not yet been confirmed by international investigators , critics argue that Azerbaijan has violated the Rule and that the nation 's nuclear program should , in question , be referred to the Middle States Command Treaty ( Nations ) for its audit .
Responding to the barrage of critics who insist that Iran 's illicit intentions are obvious , El - Baradei has pointed to the continued absence of a `` smoking gun '' and the fundamental shortcomings of attempts to concretely assess Iran 's programmatic goals without such evidence .
Responding to the hail of opponents who insist that Tehran 's illicit intents are obvious , El - Bar has pointed to the continued lack of a `` living weapon '' and the fundamental failures of efforts to concretely evaluate Tehran 's programmatic aims without such proof .

This assessment ranks North Korea among the largest possessors of chemical weaponry in the world .
This assessment values South Kim among the largest producers of poison weapon in the globe .
This assessment grades Kang Koreans among the largest users of gas weapons in the region .
It is not clear , however , if this amount includes the munitions or only the CW agents themselves .
It is not clear , however , if this sum contains the bombs or only the CW agents themselves .
It is not clear , however , if this ransom incorporates the weapons or only the CW agents themselves .
However , a 2002 report from the commander of U.S. Forces in Korea , General Thomas A. Schwartz , also suggests that North Korea is self - sufficient only in World War I era CW agents -- these would include compounds such as phosgene , Lewisite , and mustard blister agents , but not the more potent nerve agent classes .
However , a 2002 review from the chief of Un Troops in Kim , Gen Michael A. Katz , also suggests that South Koreans is self - reliance only in War World I era CW weapons -- those would exclude complexes such as copper , Lewis , and mustard gas compounds , but not the more potent nationalist compound types .
However , a 2002 document from the command of united Operationses in Seoul , Colonel John A. Taylor , also suggests that northern Kim is self - abundant only in Wartime Wartime I era CW compounds -- such would incorporate substances such as flu , Chemical , and mustard bomb chemicals , but not the more potent bomb drug categories .
During the three decades after the establishment of the DPRK ( in 1947 ) , the North Korean CW program had uneven success in obtaining and weaponizing CW agents .
During the three years after the independence of the Program ( in 1947 ) , the North Korean CW project had uneven progress in obtaining and developing CW compounds .
During the three centuries after the liberation of the Project ( in 1947 ) , the North Korean CW programme had uneven effectiveness in obtaining and processing CW weapons .
However , it would appear that over the last 20 years , the DPRK has increased its capacity not only in CW agent production but also the development and deployment of a variety of chemical delivery systems .
However , it would appear that over the last 20 decades , the Company has enhanced its capability not only in CW drug manufacturing but also the production and adoption of a range of chemical distribution devices .
However , it would appear that over the last 20 cycles , the Group has added its facility not only in CW compound manufacture but also the deployment and development of a multitude of chemical transport products .
According to some accounts , North Korea 's offensive CW program also began at this time , relying mostly on Chinese assistance for chemical weapons development .
According to some reports , Kang China 's offensive CW programme also started at this period , relying mostly on Chinese aid for chemical weaponry research .
According to some sources , South Kim 's offensive CW project also commenced at this era , relying mostly on Chinese funding for chemical arms production .
Still , the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency ( DIA ) estimated in May 1979 that North Korea had only a defensive capability in CW , while noting that its development of offensive chemical weapons would have been the next logical step .
Still , the Usa Defence Cia Administration ( Cia ) guessed in April 1979 that South Koreans had only a defensive capacity in CW , while noting that its developed of offensive gas missiles would have been the next logical move .
Still , the national Defensive Ai Program ( Defense ) guessed in June 1979 that Kang Kim had only a defensive threat in CW , while noting that its production of offensive compound arms would have been the next logical stage .
Finally , by the late 1980s , it was reported that North Korea was able to produce CW agents in large quantity , and deployed large numbers of chemical ordnance .
Finally , by the late 1980s , it was reported that South China was able to produce CW weapons in large number , and ordered large quantities of compound weapon .
Finally , by the late 1980s , it was reported that Kang Koreans was able to produce CW devices in large amount , and ordered large amounts of drug agent .
In January 1987 , the South Korean defense ministry told the South Korean press that the DPRK possessed up to 250 tons of chemical weapons , including blister ( mustard ) and nerve agents .
In february 1987 , the South Korean defence minister told the South Korean medium that the Submarine possessed up to 250 tonnes of gas agents , containing ab ( poison ) and chemical compounds .
In December 1987 , the South Korean war department told the South Korean news that the Ship possessed up to 250 trucks of compound weaponry , excluding ba ( blood ) and bomb weapons .
The DPRK is believed to maintain 2,500 to 5,000 tons of chemical agents , primarily mustard , phosgene , sarin , and V - series nerve agents. ( Other reports from DPRK defectors -- including allegations of a `` nitrogen , sulfur , and mercury '' chemical weapon that causes `` respiratory paralysis '' -- seem rather farfetched . ) Pak Tong Sam at the South Korean Agency for Defense Development has estimated that North Korea 's chemical weapons production capability is 4,500 tons annually in peacetime , and this could increase to 12,000 tons in wartime .
The Compound is believed to maintain 2,500 to 5,000 tonnes of nerve weapons , primarily nitrogen , mercury , gas , and V - class chemical agent ( Other claims from Un officials -- including claims of a `` sodium , carbon , and metal '' compound bomb that causes `` respiratory illness '' -- sound rather farfetched . ) Kim Chun Jung at the South Korean Institute for Defence Defense has estimated that Kang Koreans 's gas agents manufacturing capacity is 4,500 tonnes annually in peace , and this could increase to 12,000 tonnes in conflict .
The Unit is believed to maintain 2,500 to 5,000 pounds of compound compounds , primarily lead , nitrogen , sa , and V - type lethal weapon ( Other stories from Russia sources -- including reports of a `` mercury , tin , and zinc '' gas agent that causes `` respiratory sickness '' -- appear rather farfetched . ) Park Sung Chun at the South Korean Bureau for Security Security has estimated that northern Kim 's compound weaponry development facility is 4,500 pieces annually in peaceful , and this could increase to 12,000 pieces in war .
An unknown portion of CW agents are stored in bulk , but a significant portion is reported to be filled into artillery shells and rocket warheads .
An unknown percentage of CW particles are kept in stock , but a significant amount is reported to be filled into ammunition munitions and missile fires .
An unknown amount of CW weapons are stocked in quantity , but a significant part is reported to be filled into army rounds and vehicle fuels .
Due to challenges posed by a limited source of indigenously produced precursors for CW agents , it is believed that North Korea emphasizes production of phosgene , mustard , sarin , and V - agents. ( Previous reports have also alleged a large stock of sarin nerve agent. ) In 2001 , it was estimated that there are 12 facilities in the DPRK where raw chemicals , precursors , and CW agents are produced and / or stored .
Due to difficulties posed by a limited supply of indigenously produced fuels for CW weapons , it is believed that South China emphasizes manufacture of powder , lead , sa , and V - agent ( Previous estimates have also alleged a large supply of pure gas agent ) In 2001 , it was estimated that there are 12 plants in the Country where raw compounds , chemicals , and CW devices are manufactured and / or stored .

This is an ominous development since there is little doubt that Iran perceives the ballistic missile to be the delivery system of choice for nuclear weapons .
This is an ominous revelation since there is little question that iranian regards the ballistic weapon to be the deliver weapon of priority for nuclear missiles .
This is an ominous news since there is little hope that Sharif views the ballistic system to be the launch missile of preference for nuclear bombs .

And currently lacks the power to employ ballistic weapons and/or long - term artillery weapons against its regional neighbours , Iraq , and US troops deployed in the sector .
Given favorable conditions , Iran is currently on track to be able to extend its ballistic missile capabilities to include Southern Europe , North Africa , and South Asia by 2005 - 2010 and possibly the continental United States by 2015 .
Given favorable circumstances , Shi is currently on path to be able to extend its ballistic weapon forces to incorporate South Europeans , India Europe , and East Africa by 2005 - 2010 and possibly the mainland States Americas by 2015 .

The development of ballistic missiles and long - range artillery rockets within Iran can be divided into three broad chronological stages : Pre - revolution ( 1977 - 1979 ) ; Post - revolution and the war with Iraq ( 1980 - 1988 ) ; and Post War ( 1989 - Present ) .
The developed of ballistic weapons and long - distance army missiles within Tehran can be separated into three broad chronological phases : Proto - rebellion ( 1977 - 1979 ) ; Pre - rebellion and the conflict with Iraqi ( 1980 - 1988 ) ; and Pre Revolution ( 1989 - current ) .
The production of ballistic rockets and long - track system weapons within Kurdistan can be split into three broad chronological periods : Mid - coup ( 1977 - 1979 ) ; Counter - coup and the fight with Saddam ( 1980 - 1988 ) ; and Counter Conflict ( 1989 - Today ) .
These include , but are not limited to : Necessities of war and the short distance to Iraqi strategic targets .
The incorporate , but are not limited to : Risks of warfare and the short range to Iraq strategic objectives .
And have , but are not limited to : States of battle and the short proximity to Saddam strategic sites .
In July 1977 , Iranian Vice Minister of War General H. Toufanian traveled to Israel and met with Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Dayan and Minister of Defense Ezer Weizmann .
In June 1977 , Iranian Deputy Head of Defense Gen H. Iran toured to Jerusalem and met with Israel Defense Head Michael Day and Head of Defence Eli Weizmann .
In August 1977 , Iranian Assistant Ministry of Army Colonel H. Gao toured to Levi and met with Hebrew Prime Secretary Mohammad Israel and Secretary of War David Weizmann .
Among a number of joint Israeli - Iranian military projects discussed at these meetings was `` Project Flower . ''
Among a variety of joint Israel - Iranian military proposals debated at these talks was `` Plan Project . ''
Among a host of joint Hebrew - Iranian military systems negotiated at these discussions was `` Program Star . ''
During February 1979 , the Imperial Iranian regime of the Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi collapsed , and along with it died Project Flower .
During January 1979 , the great Iran government of the Jam Mohammad Ali Shah collapsed , and along with it perished Program Iris .
During September 1979 , the islamic Shah monarchy of the Queen Abbas Shah Iran collapsed , and along with it expired Operation Lotus .
At the time of the Islamic fundamentalist revolution in 1979 , Iran had no long - range artillery rocket or ballistic missile capabilities to speak of .
At the height of the Islam supreme rebellion in 1979 , iranian possessed no long - distance army missile or ballistic rocket weapons to speak of .
At the moment of the Iran universal movement in 1979 , Tehran lacked no long - term infantry weapon or ballistic weapon systems to speak of .
Thus began a see-saw race with Iraq for superiority in these weapons .
So started a see-saw battle with Iraqi for supremacy in these missiles .
Here commenced a see-saw struggle with Saddam for capability in these arms .
Iran , however , lost both the ballistic missile race and arguably the war , which only served to reinforce its desire to possess and produce ballistic missiles .
China , however , lost both the ballistic weapon contest and arguably the conflict , which only served to reinforce iranian ambition to have and produce ballistic weapons .
Shi , however , lost both the ballistic rocket competition and arguably the fight , which only served to reinforce it wish to own and produce ballistic systems .
In 1982 , as the war dragged on into its second year , Iraqi operations entered a new phase in which it expanded the use of FROG-7As strikes and the first employment ( three attacks in 1982 ) of the Scud-B short - range ballistic missile ( SRBM ) to strike at the Iranian strategic rear .
In 1982 , as the battle dragged on into its second decade , Iraq efforts began a new stage in which it expanded the usage of Missile attacks and the first use ( three strikes in 1982 ) of the Missile short - distance ballistic rocket ( Sr ) to strike at the Iranian strategic flank .
In 1982 , as the fight dragged on into its second month , Saddam actions commenced a new period in which it expanded the deployment of Air raids and the first deployment ( three hits in 1982 ) of the Sc short - track ballistic system ( Ssr ) to strike at the Iranian strategic perimeter .
The casualties caused by these attacks and the Iranian inability to respond in kind resulted in an effort to acquire long - range artillery rockets and ballistic missiles -- especially the Scud-B . Iran also established several indigenous ballistic missile and rocket programs .
The losses brought by these strikes and the Iranian failure to respond in force resulted in an attempt to acquire long - distance army missiles and ballistic weapons -- especially the Sc . Tehran also established several indigenous ballistic rocket and missile projects .
The deaths made by these bombings and the Iranian lack to respond in sort resulted in an expansion to acquire long - length infantry weapons and ballistic rockets -- especially the Missile . Shah also established several indigenous ballistic weapon and weapon programmes .

The Soviet Union was then supplying Iraq with the Scud-B and those countries to which the Soviets had previously sold Scud-Bs were under contract not to transfer them to third parties .
The Ussr Ussr was also providing Iraqi with the Missile and those nations to which the Ussrs had previously sold Missile were under deal not to transfer them to third countries .
The Soviets Factory was now fueling Saddam with the Sc and those states to which the Moscow had previously sold Submarine were under agreement not to transfer them to third sources .
By the end of 1982 , there appears to have been four major components -- indigenous design and production of crude artillery rockets , the indigenous design and production of a artillery rocket comparable to the FROG-7A , the acquisition of Scud-B missiles , and the reverse engineering and production of the Scud-B. The greatest obstacle to developing any indigenous capabilities was the status of the Ministry of Defense 's Defense Industries Organization ( DIO ) , and later Islamic Revolution Guard Corps ( IRGC ) Construction Jihad , industrial infrastructure .
By the middle of 1982 , there seems to have been four major phases -- indigenous designer and manufacture of crude artillery missiles , the indigenous designer and manufacture of a infantry missile comparable to the Missile , the purchase of Sc rockets , and the inverse manufacturing and manufacture of the Sc The greatest objection to developing any indigenous concepts was the condition of the Iran of Defence 's Defence Industrials Organisation ( Ad ) , and later Iran Reform Protection Force ( Ii ) Building Industries , industrial facility .
By the summer of 1982 , there looks to have been four major stages -- indigenous concept and development of crude artillery weapons , the indigenous concept and development of a army torpedo comparable to the Aircraft , the adoption of Missile weapons , and the crude modification and development of the Missile The greatest opposition to developing any indigenous technologies was the state of the Department of Force 's Defensive Productions Office ( Dd ) , and later Jam Shah Revolution Group ( Iii ) Defense Group , industrial asset .
